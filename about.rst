title: About

I use this site to write my daily reading notes for books that I learn from and
which influence me. You can expect a short post on the key themes, what I've
learned, or how my thinking has changed because of what I read.

Because I condense tens of pages into a few paragraphs there is no way I can do
justice to even the main ideas of the book. If you find any of the notes
interesting, I encourage you to read the book for yourself and compare your
ideas with mine.
