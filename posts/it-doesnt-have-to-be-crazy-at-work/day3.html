    <p>“It’s really easy to fall for someone’s carefully crafted story.”</p>
<p>When hiring or just working with someone, get to know them as a person. Everyone has families, hobbies, and worries. Get to know these things, about the people you spend 40 hours a week with. It leads to a better work environment and make sharing ideas easier.</p>
<p>Make sure your process minimizes stress. Something as simple as moving your releases from the end of the week to the start of the week can give you the weekend back.</p>
