> "Culture is what culture does."

Don't base your culture on best practices. In fact, don't base anything on best practices alone. Only use these practices as a starting point. Strive to push things forward and create something better than the status quo.

To become better than the norm, you need focus. The only way to gain focus is to say no to all the unnecessary things you are saying yes to right now.
