Drawn out goals, packed schedules, and crazy work environments sap the calm from any workspace.

Remember that packing your schedule and trying to get more done is not the way to stay creative. Instead allow yourself uninterrupted chunks of time, at least 90 minutes to work. Use this time to to accomplish what you need to and produce something of quality.

Do not try to change the world. Just try to improve and do the best you can.
