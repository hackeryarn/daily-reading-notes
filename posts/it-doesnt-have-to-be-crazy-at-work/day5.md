> "When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says 'It's no big deal' or the token that says 'It's the end of the world.' Whichever token you pick, they'll take the other."

Your company culture, your mood, even your level of stress are all determined by the small choices you make every day. Have the courage to change things for the better today. Even if it's in the smallest of ways. Block off your lunch time, say no to that pointless meeting, or go for a walk after work. Start chipping away at the insanity and win your life back.
