Have a 12 hour feeding period where you eat every 3 hours. This gives you time
for 3 snacks and two meals.

If you have to push back lunch, eat a third of your snack every hour you delay
dinner. Then eat your whole dinner and finish the remainder of the snack an 3
hours later, and have dinner at the normal time.

The base line for every meal should be 1.5 fist size portions of protein, and 3
fist size portions of vegetables. To lose or gain weight subtract or add half a
fist size portion of protein and 1 fist size portion of vegetables.

Once you achieve your ideal weight, you can add a cheat meal once per week.

Stop increasing weight you use during exercise once you achieve the standard for
strength and speed. 

Buy only a few vegetables per week. Precut them on the weekend and use the for
making fresh stir fries, soups, and salads.

Keep your meals simple. There is no need to have more than 2 vegetables per
meal. This keeps your meals from getting repetitive and boring.

To prepare delicious meals use fresh ingredients and season them with your
favorite spices and herbs.
