The same workout practice done every day becomes good for the body as well as
the mind. If you can enter flow every workout, it become a mediation practice
with physical benefits.

Youthfulness is determined by:

1. Flexibility
2. Strength
3. Speed
4. Leanness
5. Ideal body weight
6. Good posture

A trainer tells you what to do, or acts as your workout buddy. A coach explains
why you should do things a certain way so the practice becomes part of you.

Great performance doesn't come from the body alone. You can have the same build
as a professional athlete, but they will still beat you in their sport because
their brain is conditioned better than yours. This level of mind body connection
only comes through repetition.

Any physical movement consists of three phases:

1. The flexibility to perform the movement correctly.
2. The strength to perform the movement under an appropriate load.
3. The speed to perform the movement in the correct amount of time.

Speed should be your ultimate goal because you can't develop speed without
flexibility and strength. If you have the speed, you will develop the other two.

The overhead squat press is the best test for overall strength, flexibility, and
coordination.

Man should perform the squat press with 58% of their body weight.

Woman should perform the squat press with 45% of their body weight because,
compared to men, they get on average 77% strength capacity per pound.

Use the squat press to determine speed. Excellent speed is 5 seconds through the
whole movement, with your ideal weight.
