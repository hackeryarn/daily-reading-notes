  <p>The one thing all the great philosophies and religions agree on is the search for stillness in the turmoil of every day life.</p>
<p>Stillness provides us time to think, confidence to stand up for what we believe in, and the power to asses every option fully.</p>
<p>The search for stillness lies in 3 domains: the mind, the spirit, and the body.</p>
<p>The clearest, and perhaps most important, example of a calm mind comes from John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis. When he received pressure to act from his advisors, from other countries, and from the people that elected him, but instead of rushing to please he took the time and search for another option. In doing so, he prevented a war and a potential nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p>Kennedy didn’t start in the state of equanimity. He was the opposite for most of life. But, he worked toward gaining mastery of him mind. He learned to remain calm so he can resolve hard problems with a steady hand.</p>
<p>Difficult decision don’t call for snap judgments or a going with a gut feeling. They require a focus and time to analyze all the possible options. Master your mind to make the right decision under most turbulant of circumstances.</p>
