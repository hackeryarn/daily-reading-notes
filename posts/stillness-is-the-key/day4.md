An uncontrolled ego leads to either insecurity or grandeur, and both these
states lead to misery.

Stillness requires strength and confidence. It can't come from the unstable
grounds of ego.

Confidence comes through when you know what matters and the opinions of others
don't inflate your opinions of yourself or of the situation. With it, confidence
brings clarity of where you need to go and how to get there.

If we try to force things into the ideal shape, we will only end up frustrated
and miss our target. Instead, we must embrace the fluid nature of the world and
let go of the outcome.

Only by focusing on doing each step to the best of our ability can we reach
success.

When you decided the outcome, you can't adapt to the changes around you.

The Tiger Woods scandal provides the perfect example of how being out of balance
can throw a person's whole life into chaos. Tiger could remain the picture of
calmness on the golf course, but his personal life was in turmoil. The
undercurrent of his personal life, just like at see, brought down his career
and his entire life.
