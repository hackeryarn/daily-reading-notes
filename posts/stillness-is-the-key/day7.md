Any accomplishments done only for the reward at the end feel empty. True reward
is only found in helping others.

A loved one is like a wall that won't let you fall and will protect you form the
cold.

Anger might make your current endeavor successful, but it will destroy the rest
of your life. 

On a long enough timescale anger always turn on itself. It will cause ruin if
allowed to run rampant. 

To have a chance at quieting anger, you must find the power to pause and evaluate
your choice -- especially when you feel anger coming on.

When someone makes you angry, remember: it's easier to protect your feet with
slippers than carpet the entire planet. Look at what you can do, not how to fix them.

Replace anger with love, gratitude, and purpose.

Everyone shares the same planet, the same desires, and the same heartbreaks.
Learn to see the similarities in others. Only then will you find peace in your
life.

The less we believe in our exceptional nature, the more we open ourselves to
helping the world around us. 

You will only find peace by realizing that the victory or defeat of today 
means nothing on the timescale of your life.
