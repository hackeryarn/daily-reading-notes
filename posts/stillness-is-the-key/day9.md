A walk gets you away from your surroundings and opens up your mind to new ideas.

Walking causes your blood to flow throughout your body resulting in more energy
and sharper thought.

Visiting new places triggers new ideas. A change in where you visit can change
your entire mindset.

The routines of many great people may seem like mere superstition, but they
wouldn't do them win or lose if they were just superstitions.

Routines free up your mind from decisions. The simple tasks even become
automatic and let your mind wonder while your body moves.

A routine doesn't have to be time based. You can have a routine leading up and
after an event. This practice will put you in the right mindset for the activity
to come.

A person is never free if they fear to lose what they have.

The more possessions you have, the more time you have to spend maintaining them.
This leaves less time to spend thinking or with the important people in your
life.

Don't let your new possessions or status trick you into believing that you need
more things to fill up the space. Enjoy your new freedom.
