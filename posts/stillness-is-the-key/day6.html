  <p>Satisfaction only comes when you realize that what you have is enough.</p>
<p>Not being satisfied with what you have creates a hell; just like admiring what you don’t have.</p>
<p>You don’t do better work by being anxious or looking to please others. You have to analyze the situation from a place of calmness. Ask yourself “what’s the one thing you can do that will have the biggest impact on the world?” Then be satisfied with working on that one thing; even if it’s not perfect or you never finish it.</p>
<p>Don’t let your work take away the things you are working for. If you want enjoy your time with your family or the things around you, you have to make time to enjoy them. Working for them isn’t enough.</p>
<p>You don’t need extravagance to find beauty. Look for beaut in the simple things. Just look outside at how the wind blows the trees, enjoy the steam coming off a cup of coffee, or just bask in the randomness of the mess left after a hard day’s work.</p>
<p>You have to slow down to enjoy the world around you. Stop running around and always doing things. Take a moment to notice the beauty everywhere.</p>
<p>You can’t find stillness if you put the weight of the world on your shoulders; you will only end up stressed out. You can’t expect to always depend on others either; they will only disappoint you, because they are human too.</p>
<p>To find relief from the pressures of the world and to learn to forgive others for their mistakes, you must believe in something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t believe in any god or higher power, fate and fortune are forces that act on your life every day. Even mere coincidences present randomness that’s completely outside your control. It’s not all on you. Give yourself a break.</p>
