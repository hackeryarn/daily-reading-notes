Being fully present is so rare that Marina Abramovic made an emotion art display
by just being there with the person sitting across from her.

When we spend energy regretting the past or worrying about the future, we
deplete the limited supply we have for the actions in the present moment.

If we take care of the present, the future will taken care of itself.

We can't figure out what will make us happy if we never listen to our desires.

Deep and creative thinking requires time and concentration. We can't gain this
space if we fill every minute of our day with information and activities.

During war, opposing nations flood each other with information to cause analysis
paralysis. Modern media does the same to us every day.

Filter out all unnecessary information. Make time to think.
