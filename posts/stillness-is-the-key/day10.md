We don't have enough silence in our day because we don't seek solitude, and we
don't have enough solitude because we don't value silence. It's a vicious cycle
that we must break.

Solitude gives you time to reflect while everyone else is only reacting.

No one discovered anything important running from meeting to meeting or during a
3 hour tv binge.

Overwork not only causes lapses in judgment, but can literally kill you or
permanently degrade your health.

You can't find stillness if your work is never done.

"Sleep is the interest we have to pay on the capital which is called in at
death. The higher the interest rate and the more regularly it is paid, the
further the date of redemption is postponed."
-- Arthur Shopenhauer

If we go long enough without sleep we stop noticing the negative effects it has
on us; until it causes a catastrophe.
