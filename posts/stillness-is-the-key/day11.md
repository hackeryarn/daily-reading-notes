We all need something that we do for the love of it, not for the money, or the
fame, or any reward.

Getting lost in the task simply for the joy of doing it clears your mind and
helps you find pleasure and focus in the rest of your day.

We reveal who we are in how we choose to spend our leisure.

"We must be disciplined in our discipline and moderate in our moderation."

You won't get leisure without making time for it.

Any form of leisure or proactive activity can become a form of escape from
your responsibilities. Once you need something to bring you back to normal, you
have thrown your life out of balance.

"High-minded thoughts and inner work are one thing, but all that matters is what
you do."

You will never become the person you want to be if you don't have courage to
act.

"If you see fraud, and do not say fraud, you are a fraud." -- Nasim Taleb

"As a well spent day brings a happy sleep, so a well employed life brings a
happy death" -- Leonardo Da Vinci

By living well, you avoid the sorrows of death.
