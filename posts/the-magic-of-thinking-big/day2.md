Excuse is a desies that festers the more you use it. With every excuse you make
for yourself you train the habit. Soon even simple things become excuse worthy.

The four most common types of excuses are health, intelligence, age, and luck.
Each one of them can grow to overshadow any activity in your life, but combined
they can make you lose everything you've worked hard to achieve.

If you need any motivation for getting rid of an excuse, just look around for
someone who has accomplished more than you in a worse condition. It's easy to
find someone that's handicapped or old -- by societies standards -- but still
extremely successful. Is your condition really worse than theirs?

When it comes to intelligence, you are probably putting too much emphasis on the
wrong kind of intelligence. Knowing many facts or having a high IQ won't make
someone successful. Nobody wants a walking encyclopedia, besides a game show.
What counts in life is having the ability to come up with ideas and make them
reality. Too often intelligence is wasted on figuring out why things will fail.
Instead, bring right attitude and dedication to figuring out how to make things
work. You will be amazed what you can accomplish.

The worst excuse of them all is luck. It's so ingrained is society that many of
use it subconsciously. We refuse to act because we attributes the success of
other's to luck. Your coworker didn't get a promotion over you because of
luck. Take the time to look for the real reason behind other's success and you
will find a path to the same. If we just drop our egos, we can learn from
everyone around us.

Stop using these excuses to get out of doing the hard work. Get to it and make
your life what you want it to be.
