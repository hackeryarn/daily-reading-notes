  <p>Excuse is a desies that festers the more you use it. With every excuse you make for yourself you train the habit. Soon even simple things become excuse worthy.</p>
<p>The four most common types of excuses are health, intelligence, age, and luck. Each one of them can grow to overshadow any activity in your life, but combined they can make you lose everything you’ve worked hard to achieve.</p>
<p>If you need any motivation for getting rid of an excuse, just look around for someone who has accomplished more than you in a worse condition. It’s easy to find someone that’s handicapped or old – by societies standards – but still extremely successful. Is your condition really worse than theirs?</p>
<p>When it comes to intelligence, you are probably putting too much emphasis on the wrong kind of intelligence. Knowing many facts or having a high IQ won’t make someone successful. Nobody wants a walking encyclopedia, besides a game show. What counts in life is having the ability to come up with ideas and make them reality. Too often intelligence is wasted on figuring out why things will fail. Instead, bring right attitude and dedication to figuring out how to make things work. You will be amazed what you can accomplish.</p>
<p>The worst excuse of them all is luck. It’s so ingrained is society that many of use it subconsciously. We refuse to act because we attributes the success of other’s to luck. Your coworker didn’t get a promotion over you because of luck. Take the time to look for the real reason behind other’s success and you will find a path to the same. If we just drop our egos, we can learn from everyone around us.</p>
<p>Stop using these excuses to get out of doing the hard work. Get to it and make your life what you want it to be.</p>
