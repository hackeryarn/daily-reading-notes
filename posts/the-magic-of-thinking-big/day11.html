  <p>Setting a big goal lights up the journey ahead. Although you can’t achieve a big goal quickly, you can use it to guide the small decision that will bring you closer. Any time you have to make a decision, you can ask yourself: is this getting me closer to my goal? If the answer is no, then don’t do it.</p>
<p>Making the big goal not too specific also allows you to navigate to it through all the winding turns of life. Don’t set a goal like: at 30 I want to be the CEO of this company. This puts far too many restrictions on you. Instead you can set a goal like: I want to be an executive sometime in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>This approach gives you much more freedom. You loosen the time restriction to any time without that time frame. You open up the possibility of moving to another company if it brings you closer to your goal. You even make the goal achievable in more than you way. Instead of needing to be a CEO you can be any form of executive. These looser constraints make the goal possible.</p>
<p>With a realistic long term goal in place it may seem an overwhelming challenge to plan all the way to it. The good news is, you don’t have to. Take it one experience at a time. Do the best you can on the assignment you were just given. Learn something this year that will serve you in the future. Meet someone that achieved the next step in your journey. All these are small that you can plan for day by day. Before you know it they will compound to get you where you wanted to go.</p>
