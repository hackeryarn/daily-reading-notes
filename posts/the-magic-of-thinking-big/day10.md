If you never start you can't find success. People come up with countless reasons
for never starting a task, a project, or even their dream. They will claim the
conditions aren't right, or that they don't have enough time. They don't realize
that this attitude puts them into a trap of never getting anything done.

The only way out of this trap is to take action. Even if it's completely
mechanical. If you want to start writing, sit down and write about anything that
pops into your mind. Eventually you will discover ideas coming about the topic
you wan to cover. If you have an unpleasant task, like chores, that you dread
doing, just start on it without thinking about how much you dread it. Before you
know it, you will accomplish it.

Taking action moves you to the doorstep of success, but there is always the
inevitable failure. This stops most people. They see the single setback as a
sign that they aren't cut out to continue.

The few that succeed capitalize on the obstacles they encounter. Instead of back
down, they learn and get up with renewed energy. They find a way to turn every
negative into a win.

If you want success, it's as simple as these two steps. Take action on your
goal, and learn from every mistake you encounter along the way.
