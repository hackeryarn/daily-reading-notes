Before others treat you the way you want to be treated, you must learn to treat
yourself that. If you want to be respected, you must first respect yourself. If
you want an important job, you must treat your current job as important.

In fact, you rarely have control over what other people may think of you,
but you do have control over your thinking and your actions. By thinking about
yourself in the right way, with respect and importance, you appear the same way.
You start to exude positivity. It becomes infectious to others. They become more
positive around you too, starting a cycle that lifts you even higher.

Here are a few suggestions for how to improve your outlook:

Appearance of someone successful. When you look better, you feel better. That
feeling translates into thinking and actions that are sharper than when you feel
ashamed of how you look. Don't allow yourself to waste mental energy on worrying
about petty things that can be easily fixed.

Start every morning on the right foot by pumping yourself up. Give yourself a
pep talk before you head out into the world. It's easier to act your way into
thinking than you think your way into acting, so take the action of being
positive before anything can effect your outlook.

Have a role model that you can look up to. When a tough decision comes along, ask
yourself "What would my role model do?" When you have to make a moral decision,
as yourself "Is this something my role model would do?" Use this as a sanity
check to make sure you are moving in the right direction. The more decisions you
make that alight with where you want to go, the closer you will get to your destination.
