  <p>Your environment doesn’t only effect you physically, it can have a tremendous mental effect as well. You subconsciously pickup many habits and queues from people you spend your time with. As Jim Rohn said “You are the average of the people you spend the most time with.”</p>
<p>You need to take this impact seriously. Especially when looking at your workplace, since you spend as much as half your waking hours there. If you work on a team full of negativity, you need to get out. Otherwise, you will inherit that attitude and lose all your motivation.</p>
<p>Make sure you spend more time working with people that are successful driven. These types of people won’t shoot down your ambitions or try to find flaws in your approach. They will try to support and provide constructive advice that will get you to your goal.</p>
<p>This group works best if it’s a mix of people that are more successful than you, roughly the same level as you, and lower level than you.</p>
<p>The more successful people serve as role models and examples. They weathered many of the challenges you are coming up to. So they can provide warnings or guidance.</p>
<p>The people at the same level as you act as partners. They are going through many of the same challenges. So they are great for dealing with current affairs.</p>
<p>The people lower level than you are an amazing source of inspiration. They are still leading up to the challenges you are facing now. So they serve as a reminder of what you’ve already overcome. Mentoring someone also makes for a great way to give back to the world.</p>
<p>You should bring the growth attitude to you personal life as well. If you spend time with the same people or in the same place, your mind grows stale. Mix things up in your free time. The world is full of possibilities, embrace as many as you can. They will become a source of inspiration and energy for the rest of your life.</p>
