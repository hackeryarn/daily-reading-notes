We let many things hold us back in life. The most potent are the negative thoughts we
produce in our own mind.

Communicating with others is one of the most common fears. Many people are
intimidate by day to day interaction because they believe others to be better
than them in some way. They worry that they can't connect to others because
the difference between them is too great. They proceed to make it worse by
constantly replaying their past negative experiences, and delaying taking any
action.

This fear simply miss placed. We are much more alike than we think. Everyone
just want to be happy, healthy, and support those we care about. This is a level
everyone can connect on.

When you feel this fear or any other, don't compound it by your negative
internal dialogue. Instead of thinking of the negative experiences, think of
positive once. Use these experiences to build up the confidence to take the
action that will make the situation better.

Act with confidence and you will gain confidence. Give others honesty and care
and you will receive the same back.
