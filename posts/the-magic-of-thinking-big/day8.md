Your attitude matters more than you think. The energy that you put out creates a
reaction from the people around you. If you are positive, appreciative, and
strive to serve, you get the same in return. To keep the right attitude, keep the
following in mind:

No matter what the day brings, put on a smile and try to find the good in the
current situation. Once you get your body into a positive state, by smiling,
your mind follows. Then you can turn a gloomy situation upside down. 
Every fool can prosper when things are going well, but it's the brilliant people
that find the good in the worst situation.

When others do a favor for you, notice it. It doesn't take much effort for you to
address them by name and acknowledge the importance their work, but it could
change their whole day. Then they are more likely to remember you and treat you
well in the future.

The world doesn't have handouts very often. You will only get where
you want to go by showing initiative. If you want that promotion at work,
demonstrate that you have what it takes to do the job. If you want to keep a
customer around, treat them better than anyone else will. This may cost you in
the short run, but it will pay off in dividend over time.
