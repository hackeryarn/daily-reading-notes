Our thinking habits stem from the language we use. It can make the difference
between us being stuck in the current situation or moving forward towards a
better one.

Positive thinkers see the opportunities that are waiting for them tomorrow, not
the troubles of today. They aren't concerned about the small issues that pop up
daily. They are too busy building and improving towards the future.

This type of thinking allows them to get involved in bigger projects. Because
they are forward thinking, they can see outside their immediate sphere. They
realize that helping those around them will help themselves too.

Work on shifting your thinking so instead of worrying about not having enough,
you are thinking about how you could get more to satisfy your need. The world is
prospering. There is no shortage of possibilities around you. You just have to be
brave enough to go after what you want.
