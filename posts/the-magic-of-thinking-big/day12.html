  <p>To be successful in anything, you must direct your thoughts towards progress. If you become satisfied with the status quo, you will never make things better. You won’t even keep things the same, for long. The world is always in motion. Don’t let it pass you by.</p>
<p>There are two important skills that help with this mindset.</p>
<p>Treat everyone around you as a human. They all have something good to give to you. It’s up to you to be curious. Find what makes everyone around you unique. What are they better than you at? Then you can grow your appreciation for them and your teamwork will become greater than the sum of it’s parts.</p>
<p>The people around are critical to your success, but you must plot your own course through life. And there is no way to do it besides think. You must take time out of each day for solitude. This time lifts the fog from events that occurred and from yourself. It creates the perfect time to decide on a path forward before the business of life comes rushing in.</p>
<p>When you treat other well and allow yourself time to analyze, nothing can stop your forward progress.</p>
