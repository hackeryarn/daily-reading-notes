  <p>If you never start you can’t find success. People come up with countless reasons for never starting a task, a project, or even their dream. They will claim the conditions aren’t right, or that they don’t have enough time. They don’t realize that this attitude puts them into a trap of never getting anything done.</p>
<p>The only way out of this trap is to take action. Even if it’s completely mechanical. If you want to start writing, sit down and write about anything that pops into your mind. Eventually you will discover ideas coming about the topic you wan to cover. If you have an unpleasant task, like chores, that you dread doing, just start on it without thinking about how much you dread it. Before you know it, you will accomplish it.</p>
<p>Taking action moves you to the doorstep of success, but there is always the inevitable failure. This stops most people. They see the single setback as a sign that they aren’t cut out to continue.</p>
<p>The few that succeed capitalize on the obstacles they encounter. Instead of back down, they learn and get up with renewed energy. They find a way to turn every negative into a win.</p>
<p>If you want success, it’s as simple as these two steps. Take action on your goal, and learn from every mistake you encounter along the way.</p>
