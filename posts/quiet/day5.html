  <p>Our temperament is seen from an early age. Babies fall in a range between high-reactive and low-reactive. The high-reactive babies will have a lot of motion when confront with new experience. The low-reactive babies will be the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Based on the temperament, as kids grow up they develop tendencies to dive deep into creative activities, if they are high-reactive, or adventurous activities, if they are low-reactive. These experiences further shape their personalities toward shyness or adventure. However, this can be molded by pushing outside their comfort zone and varying experiences.</p>
<p>As the kinds grow older they become shaped by their environment by varying degrees. The low-reactive children won’t be impact much by the quality of their home life. They can grow up well in any environment outside of a the extremely negative homes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the high-react children are highly impacted by their environment. If they grow up in a bad environment, they will continue to draw deeper inwards and may become catastrophically sheltered. But if they grow up in a good environment, they have a high likely hood of outshining any other child. Being high-reactive can be a blessing or a curse based on the child’s environment.</p>
