Different environment require different leaders. An outgoing leader that's able
to get his team fired up is critical around passive works. However, that all
changes when the workers are already passionate and dedicated to the cause.

When the workers are amazing at their job and eager to offer up fresh ideas,
it's not talking that's needed but listening. The leader must hear what is being
said and help build out the idea further. This is the perfect job for an
introvert leader who doesn't care about getting all the glory

If you consider yourself and introvert leader, and have been told to take
speaking lessons or be more outgoing, don't give all your energy to changing
your way. It's important to be able to have some speaking skills, but it's just
as important to work on your natural strength. Try to become a better listener,
work on analyzing the situation that are presented to you. Become the type of
leader you would like to have.

From Rosa Parks to Bill Gates, leaders found strength in these characteristics.
So can you.
