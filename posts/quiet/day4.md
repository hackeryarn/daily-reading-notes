Being surrounded by noise and people all day raises your cortisol levels. This
chemical is responsible for all the things that make you unproductive. It
raises your anxiety and stress levels, and cuts off good decision
making. That's why open space work plans don't work. They create an environment
that drains you of your creative energies instead of feeding them.

Study after study has shown that people do their best work or practice in
solitude. When they are alone is when they can get a deep form of concentration
which is impossible to attain when you are afraid of being judged by a group.
People are even able to come up with more and higher quality ideas when they are
alone than in the famous brain storming sessions.

The ideas of brain storming and group think got their start from online
communities. However these communities function completely differently from in
person group work.

In online communities participants get solitude to put together their ideas
before sharing it with others. This creates the best of both world. It lets
people have the concentrated time that they need while still sharing ideas.

Despite all these benefits of solitude, face to face time still hold an
important place. It's the best way to build trust and friendships. It's the
social glue that make collaboration possible. But it's best saved for short
bursts. Then it can provide the catalyst for further work without making
everyone involved distracted from doing the work.
