Children are at great danger of having their internal drive shut down by other's
focus on extroversion. Teacher place increasing value on group work. Classmates
call them shy -- a term even a young child recognizes as negative. Parents want
them to have lots of friends and be popular. These are tremendous pressures to
put on a child.

When the child is introverted they are sensitive to these pressures and feel
like a failure every time they don't meet it. Their natural tendency to think
deeper feels wrong. This makes them spiral into anxiety every time they have to
step out of their comfort zone. What if they didn't speak up soon enough? What
if they are already labeled as shy and their idea will be dismissed? These
thoughts wrack havoc.

We need to break this cycle. Introverted nature of kids isn't something that
needs to be fixed. It's not a bad thing to be thoughtful and have
a small group of friends. In fact, it can pay off later in life.

Instead of encouraging children to just make more friends, their nature should
be respected. They need to learn how to use their natural talents to be
successful in a group setting.

A child that like writing might want to grab the note taker spot in a group, a
position the extroverted kid would hate. Similar techniques let introverts
contribute to the group while being comfortable. As they learn constructive ways
to use their gifts, their confidence grows. They don't stifle their talents and
personality trying to conform to the expectations of others.
