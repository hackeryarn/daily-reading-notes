The culture is extroverts has spread far and wide. From the seminars and books
of Tony Robbins that influence over 50 million people, to the Harvard Business
school which produces the bulk of corporate leadership.

It has gone so far that being an extrovert isn't enough. You must go as far as
knowing how to sell yourself in all situation, even just passing someone down
the hall. That's why people pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend a seminars
that teach how to sell themselves as the only path to success.

In the corporate setting, teamwork has become such an intricate part that
Harvard Business School pre-assigns study groups. Students are deemed as
unprepared for class unless they discussed topics with their study
group. They are encouraged to go to happy hours, dinners, and parties. Their
skills of developing a social network are viewed as a sign of a successful
Harvard experience.

Where does all this leave people who would rather dive deep into a topic on
their own? Must everyone become outgoing to succeed in today's world?
