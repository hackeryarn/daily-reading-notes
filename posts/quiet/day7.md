Despite what today's society might have you think, there is a reason why
hundreds of species still have a shy population.

By being thoughtful and observant, the sensitive animals can survive longer
individually. They are less like to be injured or caught by predators.

They are also they key to a group's long term survival. While all the other
animals are busy grazing, they are the ones to take a pause to look for a
predator.

In human society, they have the long term view. They are the once to notice
dangers like global warming and pollution before it's too late. They see what the
small signs around them are leading up to.

The short term view of extroverts combined with the long term view of introverts
is a critical balance in our society. We need both to prosper.
