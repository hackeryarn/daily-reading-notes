The Western extrovert ideal is far from universal. Many Asian countries value the
opposite characteristics. They don't want people that are aggressive and stir
things up. They find small talk a nuisance. They even promote people for being
quite, respectful, and humble.

The west don't see power in the perseverance required to hold up the quite idea.
What we view as passive can take tremendous amount of strength. It's not easy to
accept an unpleasant situation for the good of the group.

It's this care for the group dynamic -- weather the group is a family, a
company, or a country -- that's so valued in the East. It makes for leaders
that will dedicate themselves fully to the cause without flaunting achievements.
These leaders might not give a riveting speech, but they will do what ever is
necessary for those that depend on them.

We must learn to respect this power. Charisma shouldn't be the only way to
move ahead in society.
