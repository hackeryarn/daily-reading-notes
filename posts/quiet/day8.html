  <p>Introverts and extroverts are successful during different circumstances.</p>
<p>Introverts prosper under conditions of uncertainty. The best time for introverts is when it pays to learn from their mistakes and the stakes are high.</p>
<p>They are able to handle these times because of their analytical nature. They constantly analyze the decisions they make and adjust accordingly. This makes them able to create a plan and stick to it. They arenâ€™t chasing rewards. They are more likely to do the activity because they enjoy it in itself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, extroverts are so reward driven that psychologists are starting to define an extrovert by how reactive they are to the prospect of rewards. This make them highly driven individuals that are commit to the task as long as they see a reward in sight.</p>
<p>However, they can quickly abandon activities that require a long-term view. Especially if they see an easier path to success in a different activity. This tendency spreads them wide, instead of going deep like introverts. It leads to them to take more risks and spending less time evaluating their past decisions. They are able to prosper during the good times, but suffer greatly in the face of failure. This tendency was the leading cause of the 2008 stock market crash.</p>
