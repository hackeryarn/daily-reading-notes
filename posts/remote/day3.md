You can't rely on your co-workers for face to face human interactions.
Instead you have to make the effort to get enough interaction with
family, friends, or community groups around your town.

Despite having the ability to work any time, you should still have a
set time when work starts and ends. Otherwise, burn out will quickly
catch up to you.

Having the support for remote work allows the company to keep people
even when they need to move. In fact, it could bolster loyalty by
allowing them to live in a cheaper area while making a big city
salary.

A remote worker isn't special because they are remote. When they do
great work, it's simply great work. Therefore, no matter where they
live, they should receive the same appreciation and compensation for
the same work.

Remote workers mostly communicate through email or chat. If you can't
effectively communicate your ideas through writing, you lose out on
much of the benefit of remote work.

Former contractors make great remote workers. Both positions require
creating your own tasks, driving goals to completion, and solving
problems without someone pulling you along.
