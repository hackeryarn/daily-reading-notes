In order to disconnect and recharge from your work day, make a
physical distinction between work and home time. Some ways to do this
include only working in a designated room, having a dedicate work
computer, and getting dressed for work -- even if you could go all day
in sweatpants.

If you start loosing motivation or get too distracted at home, you can
work the rest of the day from a coffee shops, a libraries, or even a
co-working spaces.

It's easy for others to see your daily accomplishments when you write
code and they have to review it or work with it. But if you spend the
day working on admin tasks or brainstorming, make sure you share these
accomplishments too.
