Many metrics companies gather are meaningless. They are too broad to
produce insights that guide the direction of the product. These
vanity metrics only produce a cloudy picture of the effects caused by
any number of efforts.

Good metrics aren't produced from looking at the general data set with ill
defined criteria. They are produced by clearly splitting up the users into
cohorts and applying precise criteria of measurement.

The users can be split up in many ways: by registration status, the number of
visits, or specific type of interaction. The split allows you to measure exactly
which segment of users is impacted by the new feature or marketing campaign.

The metrics themselves need to be easy to understand. Click through rate can be
interpreted in to many ways to be meaningful. The number of new users, on the
other hand, is a clear metric that everyone can understand. Using precise
measurements allows you to only keep the features that have the desired
effect.

In order to make these metrics useful, you can't release multiple features at
once and expect to know which one caused the effect. People are notoriously bad
and gauging effect accurately. You will need to work in smaller batches taking
the features all the way through an analysis phase before calling them complete.
Only then will you be able to understand the full effect of your efforts.
