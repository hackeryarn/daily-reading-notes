A startup may need to pivot in any stage of its life cycle. Even a successful
company reaches the limit of where it could go with the current strategy. A
time like that requires them to decide between pivoting of persevering. Either
option poses danger in its own right.

If you decide to pivot, you run the risk of making the wrong turn, throwing away
valuable work, or even losing the ground you worked hard to gain. It's a scary
thing for anyone to take on. However, it can be the only way to test a new
hypothesis for the company and open up hidden opportunities.

With all these dangers facing a pivot, perseverance may seem like the safer
option. It let's you keep the current momentum, keep the team's morel high, and
saves you the embarrassment of admitting you were wrong. However, it can be a
more dangerous path than a pivot. By the time you start loosing customers
because of stagnation, you may have lost too much reputation to win new ones.
You might have invested so much into a dead end road that there is no way to
recover. Persevering despite the data is a sure fire way to fail.

This is why it's important to have a regular meeting where you determine if you
should pivot or persevere. Bring this question into light regularly so it's not a taboo
topic. Consider the real metrics of your business, and come up with a new
hypothesis. Then stress test this hypothesis using the testing methodologies you
previously develop. You could end up with magnificent results.
