To make a new product successful you can't blindly stick to a plan and guess and
which features to deliver. If you are working on an innovative solution, the
product has to be flexible. You should be willing to pivot on you strategy. You
may even need to modify the vision. This flexibility doesn't mean being
indecisive or eccentric.

Backup your decisions with data. Listen to your customers.
Get input as early as possible. You can spend all day arguing
internally about what the customer needs, but nothing beats getting direct
input.

In order to get this data, launch an unfinished product. Get the customer
input as early as possible. Even on an unfinished product, produces huge amount
of learning. It focuses your limited time on the features that the customer
wants. A bare minimum could be a marketing site to see if
people are even interested in what you are planning to offer them.
