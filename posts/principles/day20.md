Don't generalize. Whether you are talking about events or people,
generalizations only make it more difficult to solve problems.

When a problem occurs, identify who was responsible for the problem and what
they did to cause it. This gives you a track record for the individual and for that
type of issue. From there, you can provide the assistance needed to
the person. If they have a skills issue, you can give them training. If they
are overloaded, you can provide help. If they are struggling in a role, it
might be time for a move.

When making a plan to help them, or any other plan, don't be vague. Determine who is
going to do what and when. A "should" statement isn't going to help anyone
until you identify who is responsible for accomplishing it and give them a time
line.
