  <p>There are undeniable correlations between life and work. Both are built on relationships, both are driven and improved by the people you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>Many of the things people pursue are a byproduct of the people an culture they create around them. If money is your goal, you will never make much by just chasing money. The way to make money is to become excellent and valuable at what you do. Then learn to market it and work with others to become even better.</p>
<p>So be tough on the people in your life and hold each other to a high standard, but balance out the toughness with love and care. Those people are the foundation for your future.</p>
