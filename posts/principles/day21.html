    <p>Create a great team by starting with the design. Come up with a clear vision of where you want to see the team and the capabilities you need to achieve it. Then find the right people to fill the roles.</p>
<p>Ideally, there should be a single person to fill each role. They would need minimal supervisions and be fully responsible for their work. This means if they need assistance, itâ€™s up to them to ask for it or find someone who can help.</p>
<p>Try to avoid decisions by a comity. Requiring a group to agree is inefficient and harder to diagnose. In areas where you must involve multiple responsible parties, involve as few parties as possible. Going over 3 members is a signal of a problem.</p>
