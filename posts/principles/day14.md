Radical truthfulness is the corner stone of the most important things in life.
It allows you to build stronger relationships. You won't try to
"protect" people from difficult situation, and instead give them time
to prepare. You will grow closer than ever because there won't be hidden
agendas or tricks.

Ultimately, you can only control yourself in being radically truthful, but this
behavior is contagious. Those that get it won't want to operate any other way.
Those that reject it won't be able to stand it and will distance themselves.
This combination allows you to surround yourself with honest
people like yours.

Resulting in a feedback loop that promote growth, bring weaknesses to the
surface, and support each other in times of trouble.
