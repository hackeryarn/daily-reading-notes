Create a great team by starting with the design. Come up with a clear vision of where
you want to see the team and the capabilities you need to achieve it. Then find
the right people to fill the roles.

Ideally, there should be a single person to fill each role. They would need
minimal supervisions and be fully responsible for their work. This means if
they need assistance, it's up to them to ask for it or find someone who can
help.

Try to avoid decisions by a comity. Requiring a group to agree is
inefficient and harder to diagnose. In areas where you must involve multiple
responsible parties, involve as few parties as possible. Going over 3 members
is a signal of a problem.
