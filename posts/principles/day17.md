Throughout the years humanity saw many problems with dictatorship. People
have a tendency to become selfish and make decisions that cause harm to the
many to serve the few. So people learned to avoid putting all the power in the
hands of a single individual.

More recently we are seeing problems with a fully equal democracy.
Especially when making decisions with people of different believability. If you
wanted to learn to throw a punch, would you listen to prized fighter or a couch
potato? Why should treat other decisions any differently?

This is why you need to consider people's merit when taking advice. Believing
the advice of someone who hasn't tried or only failed to accomplish a similar goal
can be more dangerous than getting no advice at all. Be considerate of
who's advice you take and what advice you give.
