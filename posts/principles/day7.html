  <p>Before you can develop a good set of principles you need to come face to face with reality. Not the reality you wish was here, but the harsh reality that you are living in. See your flaws and failures for what they really are. Be brutally honest with yourself.</p>
<p>Then you can be radically honest with those around you. If you are honest with them, they will be honest with you. An honest feedback is the key to rapid learning and growth.</p>
<p>Take lessons from others, but don’t forget the ultimate teacher. Nature is the one thing that’s more advanced than any person or human creation. It’s responsible for everything you see. So next time you are confronted with a natural truth, take a step back and examine it from the view of nature. See how it’s part of the overall good. This is when you get a glimpse into the inner workings of the ultimate machine.</p>
