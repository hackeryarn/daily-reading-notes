It's easy to get lost in the insignificant details of your todos. Although all
those things should get done, ask yourself if there are better ways to do
them. Can you automate a repetitive task, delegate a task outside your area of
expertise, or can you say no to a non critical task? Any of these options will
help you clear your plate and focus on the highest value activities.

While working on these tasks, don't forget the ultimate goal you are after.
Picture an outcome you are excited about. The process might
become difficult but you should never loose the anticipation of the goal. If
you are no longer excited for the final outcome, maybe the goal isn't worth
working on and there is a different goal you should start.
