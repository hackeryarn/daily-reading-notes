Being open minded is one of the hardest things you can do. It required you to
go against your baser instincts when they are at their strongest. You have to
face your fears of shame, failure, and humiliation head on.

However, through these battles you gain the truth. You get to make better
decisions, see the world in new ways, and constantly improve. By being
radically open minded, you unlock your potential.

So discard your biases and need to be right. Become and explorer on a journey
to find the truth in life, and not out to prove your opinions.
