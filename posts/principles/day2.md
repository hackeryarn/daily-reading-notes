No matter how prepared you are, fate is unpredictable and you will face a loss.
It's unavoidable.

The import thing is to make sure you can handle a loss. Minimizing
your down sides by finding your neutral point. An equilibrium where you are not
loosing anything and you can sustain indefinitely. Once you identify this
point, you can take calculated risks outside of it. Knowing that you have
a cushion at your neutral point.

If you want to benefit from a loss, you need to analyze it. Compare your
assumptions to the events that transpired. Identify where you went wrong. This
will allow you to learn and grow with every loss you face.
