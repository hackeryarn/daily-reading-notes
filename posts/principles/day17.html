  <p>Throughout the years humanity saw many problems with dictatorship. People have a tendency to become selfish and make decisions that cause harm to the many to serve the few. So people learned to avoid putting all the power in the hands of a single individual.</p>
<p>More recently we are seeing problems with a fully equal democracy. Especially when making decisions with people of different believability. If you wanted to learn to throw a punch, would you listen to prized fighter or a couch potato? Why should treat other decisions any differently?</p>
<p>This is why you need to consider people’s merit when taking advice. Believing the advice of someone who hasn’t tried or only failed to accomplish a similar goal can be more dangerous than getting no advice at all. Be considerate of who’s advice you take and what advice you give.</p>
