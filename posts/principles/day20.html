    <p>Don’t generalize. Whether you are talking about events or people, generalizations only make it more difficult to solve problems.</p>
<p>When a problem occurs, identify who was responsible for the problem and what they did to cause it. This gives you a track record for the individual and for that type of issue. From there, you can provide the assistance needed to the person. If they have a skills issue, you can give them training. If they are overloaded, you can provide help. If they are struggling in a role, it might be time for a move.</p>
<p>When making a plan to help them, or any other plan, don’t be vague. Determine who is going to do what and when. A “should” statement isn’t going to help anyone until you identify who is responsible for accomplishing it and give them a time line.</p>
