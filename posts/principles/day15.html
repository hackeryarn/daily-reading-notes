    <p>People will care about the culture if they find their work and relationships meaningful. This type of culture canâ€™t happen on its own. You have to cultivate it by empowering the people with the right attitude while letting go people that are a negative to the culture. This approach is the definition of tough love.</p>
<p>You should deeply care for the people that are working for you. Making it a safe environment where people are allowed to make mistakes. Then being there to support them while they reflect, or helping them directly to find a solution.</p>
