There are many kind of people. All of them with their own strength
and weaknesses. No matter how far you have gotten on your own, you
will hit a wall when you need the help of others. The human species didn't
survive this long because of the brilliants of the hermits. It survived because
human have learned to work together in large groups.

So be open to the help and input of others. Recognize your weaknesses and fill
in the gaps. You can only complete the puzzle by filling it with the correct
pieces.
