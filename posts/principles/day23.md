We work with other for 3 goals.

Leverage to accomplish our chosen mission. At some point you will need
assistance to continue with what you want to accomplish in life.
Working with other is the only way to grow it past what you can do on your own.
Remember, the capabilities of a single person are always limited.

We want quality relationships and a great community. This is the people side of
the equation. You want to have great people in your life. People that care
about each other. People that can help you through the bad times and make the
good times even better.

We want money to allow us to afford what we want for ourselves or for others.
This is the most obvious goal of your work. We all need to earn a living. The
question is how much money do we need to have the life we want.

The best part about these 3 goals is that they are intertwined. It's hard to have
any one of these without the others. They support and build on each other.
