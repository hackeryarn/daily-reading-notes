AI could replace a biased judge and jury by a completely impartial machine that
only goes by the book. But would we want to completely take human judgment
out of the equation?

But before AI can govern us, how should we govern its creation? AI can cause
havoc if used for malicious means. With this danger should we put regulations in
place to prevent certain kind of research? Would these regulation prevent
positive advancements?

What about the right that machines face. If a self driving care causes an
accident who is liable? Why not the car? It could have insurance rates based on
the AI's driving record. Then if you upgrade your AI, your insurance costs would drop.

If we don't take the steps to regulate them like we did with
chemical and nuclear weapons, they could lead to brand new and more dangerous
arms race. It could make millions of cheap lethal weapons available on the black
market for dictators and terrorists. 

As more work is done by robots, more money ends up in the hands of the company
owners. They no longer have to hire people to accomplish much of the work. 
This effect becomes exacerbated by the distribution of more products going
digital. Digital products have almost 0 distribution cost and eliminate the
entire supply chain.

The top 20 jobs today were around for hundreds of years. New jobs created by
technology take up a small percentage of the job market.

We are moving in the direction or horses. They first lost their jobs to steam
engines and got better jobs as pulling buggies. Until they were completely
replaced by cars and the next job never came. Could AI do the same to humans?

Between a dropping cost of meeting basic human needs and the potential for
redistribution of wealth through programs like universal income, humans will
continue to survive financially. The challenge become finding fulfillment.
Hobbies and social groups will need to bring the positive benefits of work to
people's lives. They will need to provide a social network of friends, a
virtuous lifestyle, a sense of being needed, and a sense of meaning. Otherwise
people will not live happy lives.
