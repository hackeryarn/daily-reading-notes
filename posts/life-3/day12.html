  <p>An intelligence has to choose between being simple and fast or complex and slow. To reap the benefits of both, it will need to cluster tasks much like our brain has clusters to handle different skills.</p>
<p>The resource trade of today will lose it’s value when super intelligence learns to rearrange atoms into whatever configuration it needs. At that time, information will become the most valuable resource.</p>
<p>When two highly advanced civilization meet, they are more likely to share and spread ideas than to start a war. If all they want is the truth and advancement, gaining allies or converting the way others think advances civilization orders of magnitude faster than violence.</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced civilizations will reach the goal of spreading and amassing as much matter as possible. Since we haven’t spotted any such civilization, chances are pretty good that we might be alone in the 13.8 billion light years around us.</p>
<p>If we only find other civilizations that are below or at our level of advancement, then there lies a road block in our way we haven’t seen yet. If we are alone, however, then we have nearly infinite potential to grow.</p>
<p>Nature has a goal that drives it toward efficiency.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics states that all processes move toward entropy, or uniformity and heat death. There is another way explain it, however. All particle strive to re-arrange in a way to gather the most energy from their environment.</p>
<p>Life strives to reduce or maintain entropy at the cost of causing more mess around it. It’s the only known exception to the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
