The universe is changing at an ever increasing pace. It took over 9 billion
years for first life form to show up, 4 billion years to evolve to the point of
intelligent humans, and a few hundred millennia for human to change the face of
a planet.

Life 1.0 is the simplest kind of life which requires evolution to change. This
is seen in bacteria that require multiple generations to change their behavior.

Life 2.0 can learn and pass on it's knowledge making the future generations
increasingly more intelligent. This is the domain of humans.

Life 3.0 can learn and pass on knowledge, but it can also modify it's hardware. 
While humans require multiple generations to adopt our bodies to new
environment, like 3.0 will be able to modify its physical properties during a
single lifetime.

There are varying degrees of complexity between these stages -- animals aren't
quite at 2.0 and humans are starting to reach closer to 3.0 -- but the
milestones remain.
