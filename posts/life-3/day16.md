Theories allow us to reach emergent phenomenon which are more than the sum of
their parts and transcend what they are made of. A simple example of this is
wetness. It requires a whole system of molecules interacting in a specific way
to produce this overarching effect.

The closest thing we have to a theory for consciousness is the integrated
information theory (IIT). I measures the dependence between processes in a
system. It has been used to effectively measure states of consciousness during
wakefulness or dreaming, and the lack of consciousness during anesthesia or deep
sleep.

Consciousness requires at least four principles:

- Information: it has to store information.
- Dynamics: it has to have the ability to process information.
- Independence: it has to be mostly independent from the outside world.
- Integration: It has to consist of nearly independent parts.

These ensure that the system can have a subjective experience by combining all
the parts into something more.

Getting AI to the human experience requires four stages: remembering, computing,
learning, and experiencing. We have mastered memory and computing for machines,
and we are starting to understand the learning aspect. But, haven't even defined
what experiencing looks like.

Because modern circuits can communicate at the speed of line, much faster than
our brain's neural circuitry, AI stands to experience far more of it's world at a
given time than we do. This means that we may not even understand what AI
experiences.

As we move forward, we must remember that the universe doesn't give us meaning.
Our consciousness gives meaning to the universe. So, no matter who inherits the
universe, we must ensure that it's conscious. Otherwise, we will regress the
universe back to a meaningless void.
