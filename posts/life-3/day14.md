Most complex goal results in sub goals of self preservation, resource
acquisition, information acquisition, and curiosity.

Philosophers have proposed ethical systems that make sense for humans, but many
of them fall apart if we take machines into account. Even Asimov's laws of
robotics, as simple and straight forward as they are, cause contradictions.

The universe move through four stages of goals:

1. After the big bang matter had the goal to dissipate.
2. Primitive life had the goal of maximizing replication.
3. Human evolved sub goals to replication and focused on those goals. They
   thought pleasure, curiosity, compassion, and many other feeling we write
   about.
4. Machines designed specifically to help human reach their goals.

The next evolution of goals for self aware machines is unknown. But, most
possibilities lead to the destruction of humanity or a sever decrease in our
quality of life. Once machines become advanced enough we will be nothing but
ants to them. Because of this, we have to carefully consider how we will imbue
machines with goals and ethics that support not only them but also us.
