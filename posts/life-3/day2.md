People relate to AI in three ways:

1. The techno-skeptics think general AI may never happen or that it's so far in
   the future that we have nothing to worry about.
2. The utopians view the technology as a natural evolution. They welcome it
   fully and don't see the negative possibilities. 
3. The beneficial-AI movement wants to ensure that, no matter how long AI takes,
   it's to the benefit of humanity. They are taking preventive measures today
   to avert future catastrophe.

Most researchers widely disagree about when human level AI will come.

Many researchers worry about negative outcome of general AI.

We shouldn't worry about robots or evil machines. We should worry about AI
developing misaligned objectives. If we aren't careful, we could end up like an
insect getting trampled on AI's path  to a greater objective.

If AI develops a higher intelligence than us, it could manipulate our actions, or
outright control us like we control animals today.

Even simple programs have goals. But machines today don't have a self directed
purpose.
