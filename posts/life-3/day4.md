Technology continues to become twice as powerful. This new technology helps in
making the next generation that will be twice as fast too.

Neural networks present the first opportunity for computers to learn similarly
to human brain. If they are fed enough data, they can figure out that the right
choices are. Today, they are used for everything from image recognition to
playing Go.

Neural networks are a simple representation of universal computation that can
learn through training.

Deep neural networks -- consisting of many layers -- perform computation orders
of magnitude faster than shallow ones.

Neural networks are great at calculating a certain subset of equations. Luckily,
it's the same subset of equation that that govern the laws of physics. Because
of this, neural networks perform more efficiently than they theoretically should.
