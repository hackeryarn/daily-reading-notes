As a company grows, they face a choice. They can pursue growth or choose to stay
small and focus on the community, the customers, and the employees. Both options
come with their own tradeoffs, that aren't only financial. If they choose to
grow, they could spread their message further and even change the culture like 
Whole Foods or Southwest. But choosing growth also comes with it's own dangers.
They will inevitably lose a part of what made them great in the first place.
