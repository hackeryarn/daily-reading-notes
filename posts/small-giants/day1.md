A business hits its stride when it finds its soul. That's when everything
seems to flow. The employees love their work, and strive to constantly improve
themselves and the business. The customers tell all their friends about the
great new product. Even the industry recognizes the work.

During this time, the business can choose on one of two, often conflicting,
goals. They can use their momentum to grow as quickly as possible, or they can
fight to keep the soul of the company at any cost.

These companies find their soul because the owner love and care for everything
about the business. They go against the impartial, strategic manager paradigm.
Profit becomes a secondary goal to taking care of the people that work at the
company and use the product.
