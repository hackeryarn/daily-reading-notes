There are 3 pillars that make a company remarkable: professionalism, integrity,
and a real human connection. Most companies struggle to achieve just professionalism
and integrity.

Top level management can't reach the 3 pillars alone, nor can they setup a
system to mandate it. They need to hire and support the right people at the
ground level. If they want the employees to have an intimate connection with the
customers, they need to develop that connection within the company first.
Treating people with loyalty, care, and respect turns into a cascade that
propels the business forward.
