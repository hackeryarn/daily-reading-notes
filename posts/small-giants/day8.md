A great work environment for employees isn't just about pay, benefits, and a
flexible schedule. It requires intimate connection. The employees need to feel
like they are part of a community. They need to see how their effort helps the
whole company. 

An intimate connection requires everyone knowing the employee on a personal
level, even the owner. This need limits the size to which a company can grow. If
the owner gets to the point where they can't keep up with all the people in the
company, it's time to stop growing. Otherwise, they could lose that touch that
makes the company special.
