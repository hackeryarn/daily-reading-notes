Small companies are able to attract, build, and keep some of the best talent in the
industry not with luxurious pay or outrageous benefits, although sometimes those
are included, but by creating their own unique culture. This isn't the type of
culture that big companies try to push. You won't find run of the mill
motivational posters or mentions of agile. These companies create something
completely unique.

They create a culture that attracts the exact kind of people they want working
for them. And they do this by not compromising on their principles for anything.
They will work extra hours, turn down business, or even slow down growth. All in the
name of sticking to the values they established for the company.
