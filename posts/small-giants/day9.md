In addition to treating people the right way and providing at least the norm
benefits, the small giants have three more things that set them apart from
other employers:
1. A singular higher purpose that run throughout everything the company does.
2. Bonuses and perks that go above and beyond what the employees expect. These
   companies provide sabbaticals, surprise bonuses, or company retriers -- some
   even provide all this at once. They do anything they can to make the
   employees feel cared for.
3. A sense of collegiality. They don't expect their employees to develop this
   out of nowhere. Instead, they actively work on making sure stress is reduced
   and people enjoy their work. Then the employees can focus on working together
   instead of sabotaging each other for the next raise.
