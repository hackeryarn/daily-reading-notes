    <p>We negotiate every day. Everything from a pay raise, to what to have for dinner is a negotiation. The only thing that changes is the stakes.</p>
<p>We generally view negotiations as having two outcomes. Either we give something up or we win by making the other person give something up. This is a sad zero sum view of the world. It’s the view of if there is a winner there must be a loser.</p>
<p>However, there is a better way. Put your efforts together and focus on the problem. Don’t make either of the participants lose anything. Instead, focus on the problem, build a better relationship, and make the problem the only loser.</p>
