It's not enough to address the problem objectively. Every negotiation also
involves people. With people come people problems that are separate from the
main issue at hand.

First off you need to understand the other parties perspective. They might not
see things the same way. They might hold biases. Or they might feel like they
didn't get to participate in the process and are getting a solution force onto
them.

You need to consider their emotions. Let them vent if they need to. Express
your feelings. Let them know how you feel not what they did or how they made
you feel. And don't react to their emotional outbursts.

Most importantly, focus on the process of communication. This means listen to
them and treat them as an equal in the discussion.

By putting addressing these people problems up front, you build a stronger
relationship. A stronger relationship makes for better future negotiations. By
tackling the problem together you become partners instead of opponents.
