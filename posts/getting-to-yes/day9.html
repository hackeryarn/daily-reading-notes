    <p>In every negotiation you should address emotions, strive to understand the other side, and use facts. This gives you more than an argument. It gives you a way to get a better outcome in any situation, even with people who are the complete opposites of you.</p>
<p>To make the negotiation go smoothly, prepare yourself for the negotiation. Thoroughly research the subject so you can present strong reasoning for your arguments. Counter them with facts and figures. During the negotiation, ask questions so you can enrich the information you already have and strengthen your position even during disagreement.</p>
<p>Finally, always come into a negotiation expecting to influence the outcome. No matter how little power you have, show that you care. Donâ€™t claim defeat before you try.</p>
