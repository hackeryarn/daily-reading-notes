Just like in martial arts, there is a better way to approach disagreement than
head on. You can redirect their push to your advantage.

They may criticize you, attack your ideas, or dig their feet in. Don't get
defensive or take an attack personally. Use their feedback to further
the analysis of the problem. Don't try to change their position. Ask questions
about their position to help you come up with alternatives.

Instead of getting further apart on the solution, be understanding of their
position. Make yourself their ally in solving the problem you face together.
