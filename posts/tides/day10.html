  <p>People have utilized tides for energy since the Egyptians in 200 AD. They had simple systems that used the tides to irrigate fields by pumping water down a network of canals spanning large fields.</p>
<p>Then came the use of water wheels to grind grain. The first itteration of these wheels relied on the flow of water passing by. This was a slow process that only assisted in the grinding process, but could not take it over fully. Later on, these systems expanded to capture the high tide behind a gated damn and release it during low tide. These systems not only powered the milling completely, but could run the entire interval between a low tide and high tide: 6 to 8 hours.</p>
<p>Today, we are looking towards the tides to help with the energy crisis. Scientists are still looking for the best way to provide power but they have come up with a number of promising solutions. They have use large damns, similar to the systems used to grind wheat, with multiple turbines, but found them to have a terrible ecological impact. A system finding popularity today place windmills or turbines, shaped like a lawn mower blade, under the ocean to directly gather energy from the incoming tide. This solution is able to generate hundreds of megawatts under the right condition, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The tides offer a predictable energy source that would compliment the unpredictability of solar and wind energy. By combining all the renewable options, we could rid ourselves of our dependence of fossil fuels.</p>
