Past societies viewed tied differently across the world. Some saw tides of 6
inches, like the Greeks, while others saw tides of over 20 feed, like in India.
As cultures started to mix, The only thing that seemed to tie all the tides
together was the moon.

The societies with small tides credited only the moon for influencing them. They
thought that there were the daily cycle tied to the rising of the moon, and the
spring cycles during the full and waning moon.

Other cultures knew better. With larger tides, they noticed the changes in the
tide cycle throughout the year. Many of these societies had extensive knowledge
of the cycle of the tide, but they did not understand why the cycles occurred.
Like many early cultures, they attributed this to mythical forces.

It took Newton to suggest gravity to finally bring understanding to the forces
effecting the tide. However, his discovery did not make the problem easier. The moon
could no longer be the only thing acting on oceans, the sun had a major part as
well. Due to the elliptical of the moon around the earth and the earth around
the sun, the problem became increasingly hard to figure out.

People quickly realize that the 2 or 4 cycles they previously though existed
was a gross underestimate. With careful calculation and observation, cycles were
found ranging from only hours to thousands of year. In total, over 400 lunar
cycles were discovered and documented.
