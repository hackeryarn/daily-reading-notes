Humanity relied on the moon as early as 600,000 BC. It was important to many
aspects of culture. Even civilizations that did not live by the sea, and see
the moon's direct effect on the tide, placed a great importance the effect the
moon had on the world around them.

The moon was seen a symbol of fertility because of how closely it stayed with
female cycle. This also made the moon great for time keeping. While the sun rise
and sun set marked the start and end of the day, the moon's cycle were used to
represent months.

These cycle became so important in societies that while the moon was growing,
activities were conducted that had to do with growth, such as planting seeds and
procreation. While the moon was shrinking, activities were conducted that
had to do with the removal of things, such as healing and harvest crops.

The full moon was celebrate as a sign of wholeness, while the "dark" moon was
seen as dead. Societies prayed and even went as far as offering sacrifices in an
attempt to bring the moon back to life sooner.

Knowing the long cultural interleave with the moon , it's hard to believe how
distant we become from the moon. The next time you are outside at night,
take the time to notice where the moon is and what it's doing. Rekindle some of
the connection that your ancestors felt to the moon.
