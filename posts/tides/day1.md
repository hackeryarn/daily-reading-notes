Tides have an impact on just about everything on our planet. Animals plan
migrations around the tides. Species reproduce according to the tides. Entire
cultures make living around the tides' schedule. Even with the importance
that
they have on our planet, tides still are not fully understood.

Although tides can be predicted to a degree according to the moon, a precise
prediction becomes far more complicated. The moon isn't the only force acting
on the tides. The sun also has an effect despite the great distance. These
forces are made even more complex by the their orbits. They revolve around
each
other in elliptical patterns, rarely in the same position twice. This makes
tides a mysterious force to this day.
