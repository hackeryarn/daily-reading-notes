Newton was against his own theory of gravity. He couldn't accept an invisible
force acting on everything. However, his math kept coming back to a force being
there. He could explain how this force worked. He just couldn't explain what it
was, and to this day we still can't fully.

The final test of his theory was explaining the tide. He did so by coming up
with a simplified model of the earth, involving only the moon, no sun, and two
islands: one island at the top and one directly facing the moon.

As the moon applies it's gravitational force to the ocean closest to it, a
centrifugal force, due to rotation, is pulling the ocean on the opposite side
away. This gives the ocean an elliptical shape. With the moon position
closest to the island on the right, it exposes more of the island at the top and
less of the island facing the moon. Thus showing how the moon causes a high tide
at one location and a low tide at another.

This basic model grows more complex with the tilt of the earth, the motion of
the moon itself, and the addition of the sun. But a good starting point is the
simple model. This ability to break down a problem to the important pieces that
explain the essence without unnecessary complexity, made Newton's theories
stick.
