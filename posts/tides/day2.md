Environments, predators, and prey evolved to depend on each other so heavily
that it's hard to tell which influenced the evolution of the other. Without
the
environment, like the tide, there would be no opportunity for the animals
to exist.

Animals follow the cycles of their environment. They use their surrounding as
cues. The cues can trigger small cycle which occur with every tide. For
example,
the mudshrimp burrow when the tide is low and come to eat and mate when the
tide is hight.

It can also drive cycles on a grander scale. Like the migration of the
sandpipers. These tiny birds embark on journey of thousands of miles every
year
while synchronizing their midpoint feeding time with the few days that the
mudshrimp are at their peak abundance.

This type of interleaved relationship shows how fragile the balance in nature
is. If the tides were to change, the shrimp might not come out in time. That
would be catastrophic for the sandpipers. These birds are at their weakest
before they get to feed on the mudshrimp. Without the mudshrimp, the
migration
could be catastrophic to the sandpipers.
