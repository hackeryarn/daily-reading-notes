<p>The commander treated every situation with the utmost professionalism. He won the manâ€™s trust through his discipline.</p>
<p>The first officer was the complete opposite. He was friendly and open with the men. The whole crew became his friends. They laughed and joked around every time they were off duty.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, they both respected each other. Each one was meticulous when it came to their work and held themselves to a high standard. They even refused the potential to abandon their post because of a shared sense of duty.</p>
<p>Much like Kohler and Chatterton; they were polar opposites on the surface but shared a passion and moral code that tied them together.</p>
