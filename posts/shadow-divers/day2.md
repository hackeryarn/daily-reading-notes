Shipwreck divers face countless dangers. When going down they could lose the line, get caught up in a current, or become intoxicated by nitrogen. Inside the wreck, they can easily get lost or snagged on debris. And on the way up they can suffer permanent injury or death from the bends.

They only have one prevention for all these troubles. Staying calm and solving their problems one at time.

Take a note from divers in these dire situations. Next time you are in trouble, don't panic. Take it one step at a time and resolve your problems one by one. You will find a daunting task shrinking and becoming resolved.
