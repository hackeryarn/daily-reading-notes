The greatest reward the divers received was letting the families know that someone
still cared about their dead husbands, brothers, and friends. There was no
amount of money or publicity that could be greater than that.

After all, we are made for each other. What greater purpose could you have
than helping fellow man? Marcus Aurelius put it best. "What's good for the bee
is good for the whole."

If you have trouble finding a purpose, look no further than in making someone
life better. You can't go wrong if you set out with a mission greater than
yourself.
