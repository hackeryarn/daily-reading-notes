  <p>u-boat. It might have worked out for Kohler, but Chatterton is getting dangerously close to sacrificing everything for this wreck.</p>
<p>Many people that accomplished great things let themselves become consumed by an idea. But it’s not the only way. You can approach problems with moderation and longevity. If you can’t find a solution to the problem after giving it your all, move on. Tackle other tasks. You might get a flash of insight. You might even solve a bigger problem than the original.</p>
<p>Chatterton was able to discover 4 new wrecks and become famous, but he could not give up on the sub. Clinging on a to anything that much turns toxic. It drains you and makes you lose sight of what else you could do.</p>
