Sailors hold their most secret spots in a book of numbers. Some use these numbers as their lively hood by taking others there for fishing. Others do it for the thrill of exploring the unknown. They love the exploration and aren't concerned if it's a great wreck or a literal pile of garbage.

This passion echoes across disciplines. No matter the vocation, there are those that enjoy every minute of what they do. They live for the challenges and thrive on what other find mundane.

You should find at least one such activity to spice up your life.
