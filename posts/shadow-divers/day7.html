  <p>Nagel and Chatterton tried to keep the u-boat a secret and do research on their own. But they could only get so far on the on their own.</p>
<p>When they caved and put out a press release about their discovery, they got more information in a week than in months of research. Others got excited about the discovery, they had a passion for u-boats, or lived during the period. All these minds opened up treasure troves of information hidden before.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of asking questions or asking other for help. Keeping an idea a secret is not the way to gain the most from it. Instead, share your idea as early as possible. You will get help and advice.</p>
<p>Even if someone copies you or steal it, they will only gain the idea at that stage. Something special about you made you have that idea. Itâ€™s that same something that will drive you to make the idea better and push it further than anyone else could.</p>
