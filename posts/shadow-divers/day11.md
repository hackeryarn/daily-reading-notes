Chatterton tried a new strategy for exploring the u-boat. Instead of rummaging
through the debris, he stopped and calmly absorbed his surrounding. Allowing
himself to notice more than he had before.

Taking it slow , especially with tough problem, can be seem counter productive.
You want to start resolving the problem right away. However, there is a better
strategy. If you take a step back and allow yourself room to process, you gain
insight you previously wouldn't have.

This is a good approach to all sorts of problems. Abraham Lincoln even summed
it up in saying "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the
first four sharpening the axe."
