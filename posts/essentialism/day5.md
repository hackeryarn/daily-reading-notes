Your answer should be either hell yes or no. This means only saying yes to the
top 90%.

For every opportunity or option you are considering set 3 minimum criteria
and 3 ideal criteria. If the opportunity fails any of the minimum criteria or
2 of the option criteria, it's an automatic no.

We end up with hundreds of options when searching for good. Strict criteria
eliminate the majority of those options.

Make your goals "really clear", not "pretty clear".

A good goal is concrete, has and end, and eliminates thousands of later decisions.

A goal with a clear direction inspires more than a vague grandiose one. Nobody
knows how to stop world hunger, but you can come up with a plan to feed 100
homeless this year.
