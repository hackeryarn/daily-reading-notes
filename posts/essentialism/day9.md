The strongest motivator are achievement and the recognition of achievement.

Start small and build momentum. Don't go for the big all in win.

Seeing progress and being encouraged produces better results than threatening
punishment.

To build momentum, make the smallest amount of progress possible. If you want to
write, start with a paragraph per day.

Prepare early and in small increments. Splitting an assignment over a month
makes the work far easier than cramming it into the last day.

Design routines so your brain can go on auto pilot. Then you will have reserves
of energy for the difficult problems.

All bad habits have triggers. To break a bad habit, associate a positive habit
with the existing trigger.

To build a new habit, use an existing routine as a trigger. Then just add your
habit to what you already do.

Do the most difficult thing first so you have energy to give it the focus it
deserves.

Changing a routine takes enormous concentration. Tackle them on one at a time.
