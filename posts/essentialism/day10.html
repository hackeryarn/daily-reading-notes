  <p>You can only focus on one thing at time.</p>
<p>You can still do multiple things once, but all except one should require no focus. Doing dishes while thinking on a problem is a great way to accomplished a task while focused on thinking.</p>
<p>To bring focus, pause to create a list of your top priorities. Then give each one your full attention until it’s finished.</p>
<p>Before you move on to the next activity take a deep breath and let the past fall away from you.</p>
<p>To become successful at essentialism, it has to be at your core. The non essential activities should be the slip ups, not the norm.</p>
<p>Don’t let opportunities that come with success distract you from your most important work.</p>
<p>Don’t practice essentialism, become and esstialist. Then it’s not another thing on your growing list of todos, it become who you are.</p>
<p>The essenialist leader: - trusts in less but better. - Hires on only those that are absolutely right for the job. - Removes anyone that holds the team back. - Asks what is the one thing he could focus the team on that would bring the most value. - Provides each team member with a clear focus of where their highest contribution lies. - Listens so he can figure out the essentials. - Only checks in to figure out where he can help. - Builds a uniform team by having consistent goals and communications.</p>
