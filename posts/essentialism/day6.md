Every no to a new commitment strengthens an existing one.

People say yes quickly because they are afraid of the initial awkwardness, but
they miss out on the long term cost of failing to meet a commitment when they
become overloaded.

A no to a commitment will not change a relationship.

Bring focus to the tradeoffs. What would you give up to find the commitment if
it wasn't presented to you.

A failure to meet a noncommittal yes will tarnish your reputation. But a clear no
will garner you respect.

The organized person knows all their commitments and possess the awareness to
say no. The disorganized person will overload themselves with too many yeses.

Ways to say no:
- Pause before answering will give you time to think, and let the other person
  consider the implications of their request.
- Give a "no but" with an option that works for you.
- Ask to check your calendar before responding. This gives you time to consider
  you options and an easy way to get out of the commitment.
- Use email bounce backs for focused work, not just vacations.
- If your leader asks you to do something, ask them what you should . 
- Give them another option that would require less commitment from you. "You are
  welcome to X. I am willing to Y."
- Suggest someone that would be happy with the opportunity. This will help the
  person asking and the person receiving an opportunity.
  
The sunk-cost bias prevents us from quitting when we should. Think of what else
you could do with the time and money you are going to keep pouring in with no
return.

The endowment effect makes us value what we own more than we would pay to
attain it. To fight this effect, get over the fear of waste and ask yourself
what you would pay if you didn't own it already.

Instead of forcing a bad fit, admit your mistake and learn from it.

Question past choice and established practices, otherwise you may fall into the
status quo bias.

When you evaluate your schedule, make ever activity earn it's worth from
scratch. Don't keep it around just because it was there before. Apply zero-based
budgeting to your schedule.

Run a reverse pilot by temporarily eliminating activities you suspect to having
little value.
