Become the editor of your life. Make it clearer, simpler, and more enjoyable.

Cut out options so you can avoid mental fatigue and indecision.

Condense your life by doing more with less, not trying to squeeze more
activities into your already packed schedule.

Continuously adjust your systems and philosophies toward your ideal life. 

Know when to stop editing. If you try to change everything, you will wear
yourself down and make things worse.
