There are no solution, there are only tradeoffs.

Only allow yourself as many goals as you have time for. Then give all your focus
to them one at a time.

Don't ask "how can I do it all?", ask "What can I go big on?"

If you have 4 things you want to do and you want to excel, you
need completely reject 2 of them.

Create space to escape and explore life.

Despite popular belief, eliminating boredom and down time will result in worse
outcomes.

Give yourself time to think. It can be 5 minutes every morning or two solid
weeks a year.
