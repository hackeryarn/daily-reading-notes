  <p>Happiness is our ultimate goal in life. However, it can be tricky to achieve. We all think that different things will make us happy. A lot believe money is the answer. Others want a big family and great friendships. Some just want someone to be there for them on a lonely evening.</p>
<p>It’s hard to nail down what will make you happy because it’s tough to define what happiness actually is. If you treat happiness as the feeling you get when you feel good, confident, and full of energy, then it’s pretty easy to achieve. 80 percent of it is physical.</p>
<p>The key to feeling better lies in sleep, exercise, and diet. These are the things that impact how you look and feel every day. Without getting them under control it’s tough to feel good about yourself.</p>
<p>Once you start functioning and feeling better, you increase your chance of getting everything else you want. That’s all you can really do to achieve those other goals. Most other goals depend on circumstances you don’t have direct control over. You may never get some of them, but you can increase the odds.</p>
