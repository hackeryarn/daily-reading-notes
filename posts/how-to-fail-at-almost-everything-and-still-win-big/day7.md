All the hard work, practice, and learn won't help you find success. It has to
find you. Any amount success involves a great deal of luck. The best you can
do
is be prepared for when it comes.

This might sound discouraging. How long must you wait? This isn't the message
you want to hear in a society of instant validation and reward. Nobody wants
to
wait until they are 60 to finally become successful. However, you can boost
your chances of getting lucky by learning to recognize patterns.

When you see the every day patterns, you can take advantage of those
patterns.
Taking the route with the highest chance of success means you will succeed
more
often. You can let the odds fight in your favor. All you have to do is apply
the skills you've learnt to the best of your ability.
