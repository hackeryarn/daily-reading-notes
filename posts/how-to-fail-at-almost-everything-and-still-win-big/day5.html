  <p>Unless you have a superb natural talent that you cultivated from childhood, you can’t be successful with a single skill. Instead, you need to focus on learning as many skills as you can. You don’t have to master these skills, just become good or even mediocre at them. The more you know the more you are able to learn.</p>
<p>As you gather knowledge about a single topic, any topic related to it become easier to understand. You can see this in math. If you know how to add, multiplication become easy to explain in terms of addition. Learning it in those terms of something you already know makes it faster to teach and you can remember.</p>
<p>Once you start making connections between related topics, you start looking at things from a higher level. You get to see the thread connecting seemingly unrelated things. Most people only see the connections within their field.</p>
<p>Once you start seeing the connects between fields, you gain insight that puts you far ahead of others. In fact, throughout history some of the biggest breakthrough in most fields are attributed to outsiders of that field. These outsiders have a different perspective. That lets them come up with novel ideal others cannot imagine.</p>
