When incorporating a new habit into your system, it's important to remember
to
do it daily. The duration or intensity doesn't matter. The only thing that
matters is that you do it.

Take working out for example. It's hard to build a workout habit without
doing
it every day. If you have rest days built into your habit, it's easy to treat
any day as one of your rest days. You start negotiating with yourself about
when
you can take a rest day.

On the other hand, when you get ready to do your habit for the day, most of
the
time you will become motivated enough to see it through. There are even ways
to
increase the likelihood of following through. One of them is to set a regular
time for your habit. This allows you to have the time do it and absolves you
of
needing to find room in your schedule to fit it.

You can use this method of habit creating for any type of habit. So go out
and
use it to create a system that moves your life in the right direction every
day.
