There are two skills everyone should learn: psychology and holding
a conversation. They are abundant fields which you can always improve in.
Every
time you learn more of either one, you gain a permanent improvement in your
life.

Psychology helps you understand people. You start to see that people aren't
as
reasonable as you or they would think. People react to the
various input and biases they built up. Understating this lets you avoid
falling victim to the psychological traps all around you. You can even use
what
you learned to persuade others.

Becoming better at holding conversation might seem trivial, but it has an
echoing benefit on your life. If you can have a good conversation, they will
like you. When someone liked you, they are more likely to speak well
about you, recommend you for a new position, or just help you out. The good
news is you don't have to be born with this skill. You can learn it. The
simple
way to become better at holding conversations is to smile, ask questions,
avoid complaining, and have some stories ready to tell.

With these skill you can boost your personal and professional life.
