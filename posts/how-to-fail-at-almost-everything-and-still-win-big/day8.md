Happiness is our ultimate goal in life. However, it can be tricky to achieve.
We all think that different things will make us happy. A lot believe money is
the answer. Others want a big family and great friendships. Some just want
someone to be there for them on a lonely evening.

It's hard to nail down what will make you happy because it's tough to define
what happiness actually is. If you treat happiness as the feeling you get
when
you feel good, confident, and full of energy, then it's pretty easy to
achieve.
80 percent of it is physical.

The key to feeling better lies in sleep, exercise, and diet. These are the
things that impact how you look and feel every day. Without getting them
under
control it's tough to feel good about yourself.

Once you start functioning and feeling better, you increase your chance of
getting everything else you want. That's all you can really do to achieve
those
other goals. Most other goals depend on circumstances you don't have direct
control over. You may never get some of them, but you can increase the odds.
