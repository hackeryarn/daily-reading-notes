Your brain isn't that different from a computer. You have the power to change
it's state and train it to perform the way you want. The difference is the
interface you use to control it.

Instead of using a keyboard and mouse, you have to use your actions,
thoughts,
and physical state. These are the tools that you can control to influence
your
mental state. Things like sitting up straight can completely change your
mood.
Slowly building up a habit can lead to you accomplishing amazing or
abandoning
addictions. Learn these tools and unlock the unlimited potential inside all
of
us.
