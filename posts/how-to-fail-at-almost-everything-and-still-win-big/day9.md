Your behaviour and preferences are programmable. The most important method of
getting rid of habits is to avoid leaving a gap. When you get rid of an old
behavior, you need to replace it with a new behavior that's easier, more
convenient, or make you feel better. This is why pairing quiting a behavior
and
starting a new one works well.

Let's use diet as an example. If you want to stop eating sweets, you should
choose something you will eat instead. Let's replace it with fruit. It's
close to the flavor profile of sweets but it has positive health benefits
instead of negative ones. You get to replace a bad habit with a good one.

Having a replacement selected isn't enough. You need to make it easy for
yourself to make the switch. Get rid of all the sweets in your house, making
them hard to access. Replace them with fruit that you keep stocked,
making it easy to access.

Then you give yourself permission to eat as much fruit as you want when
you crave a snack. You will be too lazy to go to a store to pick up
sweets when you have an alternative close by. This eliminates the willpower
you
would need if you had both around. Saving your limited amount of willpower
means you are more likely to follow through with this and other habits you
are
trying to form.
