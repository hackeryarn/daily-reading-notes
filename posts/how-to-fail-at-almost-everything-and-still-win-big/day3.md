Hold yourself as the highest priority. If you don't take care of yourself
first, you can't show up as your best self around others. You gain energy
when
you eat right, workout, and do what you enjoy. Think of this energy as a bank
account.

Before you can buy something you want, you have to get enough money. If you
don't have the money to afford it, you end up in debt. Your energy works the
same way. Debt can help get through a tough time, but don't let it build up.
Try to keep a positive balance of energy. That way, you have energy to spare
when an energy draining even suddenly pops up, and don't need to go into
energy
debt.

This approach may seem selfish, but it's not. With more energy you can
accomplish more, work faster, and be an overall more pleasant person. That
will
make you better at everything else.

However, don't take this too far and become egotistic. Your goal is to take
enough time for yourself so that you don't feel drained at the end of the
day.
You succeeded when you wake up with anticipation and go to bed proud of your
accomplishments.
