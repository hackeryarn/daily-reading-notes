Setting goals is a sure way to feel like a failure most of the time. When you
set a goal, at best you spend majority of your time anticipating the final
moment when you get the goal accomplished. At worst, you working hard for
a failure.

What happens when you accomplish your goal? You get to celebrate for a few
minutes, a few hours, or a few days. Then you are left with a void to
fill with another goal. This new goal could require years of work just to
feel those few moments of celebration again.

Instead, create systems. Don't set specific goals with a milestone you want
to
hit. Come up with a method that is successful most of the time. Then practice
that system daily. That way, you succeed every time you follow your system,
not
only when you accomplish a far off goal.

Your system should make you a little better every day. A perfect example is
exercise. When you set out with a goal to lose 10 pounds, what happens when
you
lose it? You feel excited that you accomplished your goal! Then it's
back to your old ways, because you deserve a reward after achieving goal.
Soon
enough, those 10 pounds are back.

A better approach to exercise is to create a system. Decide to workout every
day for 10 minutes. This is different because it has no termination date. You
are never done with a system. Instead, you get to accomplish a manageable
goal
every day. You will lose those 10 pounds with the system. Eventually you may
even lose 15. But the weight you lost won't ever come back.

Which results would you rather have?
