  <p>Passion is bullshit. Nobody has been passionate about something they are bad at. People are passionate about things they are good at.</p>
<p>People hate frustration. They will do anything to avoid embarrassment. That’s why people enjoy things they are good at. It’s not the passion that made them good at those things. It’s being good that made them passionate.</p>
<p>Passion builds when they get excited about the prospects of what to come. That’s when you want to put in the late hour. That’s when you are willing to dedicate yourself to the task. However, passion dies if nothing good is coming from the activity. Passion is a great answer for how you got here.</p>
<p>No one wants to say they got here through dumb luck. They don’t want to say they worked hard because it would make them rich. They don’t want to come off overconfident and say it’s because they are just that good. Passion is the easy response because it’s something anyone can possess.</p>
