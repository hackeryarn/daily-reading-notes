  <p>Setting goals is a sure way to feel like a failure most of the time. When you set a goal, at best you spend majority of your time anticipating the final moment when you get the goal accomplished. At worst, you working hard for a failure.</p>
<p>What happens when you accomplish your goal? You get to celebrate for a few minutes, a few hours, or a few days. Then you are left with a void to fill with another goal. This new goal could require years of work just to feel those few moments of celebration again.</p>
<p>Instead, create systems. Don’t set specific goals with a milestone you want to hit. Come up with a method that is successful most of the time. Then practice that system daily. That way, you succeed every time you follow your system, not only when you accomplish a far off goal.</p>
<p>Your system should make you a little better every day. A perfect example is exercise. When you set out with a goal to lose 10 pounds, what happens when you lose it? You feel excited that you accomplished your goal! Then it’s back to your old ways, because you deserve a reward after achieving goal. Soon enough, those 10 pounds are back.</p>
<p>A better approach to exercise is to create a system. Decide to workout every day for 10 minutes. This is different because it has no termination date. You are never done with a system. Instead, you get to accomplish a manageable goal every day. You will lose those 10 pounds with the system. Eventually you may even lose 15. But the weight you lost won’t ever come back.</p>
<p>Which results would you rather have?</p>
