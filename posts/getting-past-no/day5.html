  <p>You can’t reach an agreement simply by making the other side see your point. There are many human factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>The other side may feel like their needs aren’t heard if they aren’t involved in the problem solving process. It’s up to you to involve them early and keep them engaged throughout the solutioning process. When they feel involved, they advocate for the solution because it become their solution too.</p>
<p>They may also be worried about looking weak, or backing down from a position they publicized. In this case, you need to come up with a concession on your side that doesn’t cost you a lot but has a lot of value for the other side. It could even be something you were already planing on doing, just cast in a new light.</p>
<p>No matter where their reservations come from, it’s your job to stay with them through process. Take your time together to ensure the agreement is clear and mutually beneficial. The happier both sides are, the stronger their agreement becomes. Build a relationship to last. Don’t try to pad your ego today by causing repercussions tomorrow.</p>
