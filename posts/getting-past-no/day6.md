You might have met all the other sides needs, gave them more than they
originally wanted, and made it easy for them to go back on the points they had
to compromise on. However, you still can't get final yes.

They might still have a point of pride , or believe that you have to
lose in order for them to win. That's when you have to show your power.

But don't threaten or intimidate. That will only undo all the work you put in up
to this point. Instead, use your power to educate. Separate yourself from the
outcome and let them know what will happen if the agreement isn't reached.

After laying what the path without an agreement, let them know that the
golden bridge you built is still open. Then allow them to choose. This
will make the final decision their choice and not something imposed by you.
Letting the other side make the final decision is the best method for letting
everyone leave the negotiation satisfied.
