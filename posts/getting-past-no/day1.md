To have a mutually beneficial negotiation, you can't force your way. Just like
with a running river, no matter how hard to try it won't change it's course
because you will it.

You must first accept the situation and align your intentions with those of the
person on the other side of the table. Only once you are both calm and see the
problem from the same perspective can you start flowing together.

Be like a martial artist and redirect the energy that is thrown your way. Your
job isn't to prove the other person wrong. That would only serve to anger them
and make them dig their feet in.

Help them to find your solution. Better yet, provide them with the energy to
find a solution that's better than what you could have come up with on your own.
