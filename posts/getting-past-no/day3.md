Once you have your emotions under control, it's time to help the other person
get control of theirs. This requires you to take the time to listen. Try to
really understand where they are coming from.

If you find even 1% that you agree on, you should acknowledge it. Cling on to the
smallest shred of agreement so you have a starting point that you can build
upon. Even restating what they said and getting them to acknowledge that you
understand might be enough.

After fully hearing them out and understaing where they are coming from, you can
start stating explaining your point. However, you must do it carefully.
Keep the other persons experience and perspective in mind. Under no means should
you invalidate their views. Add to their view, and avoid the toxic "but".
Instead of pointing out what they did, only state your experiences and how
situations made you feel. Then you can both build a better understanding of
the other's position.
