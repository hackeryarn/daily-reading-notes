  <p>A hero must be weary when searching for the ultimate boon. It never comes easy. There are many challenges to overcome and much to give up. In addition, this boon is rarely what it seems.</p>
<p>Like King Midas, if a hero looks for the wrong thing, it can destroy his life. Midas got all the gold he ever wanted. The price he payed was everything that made him happy.</p>
<p>Make sure you are after the right thing in life. Often, you donâ€™t need to find anything to make you happy. You just need to learn to appreciation what you already have.</p>
