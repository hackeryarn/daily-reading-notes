The victory the hero achieves can be too great a pleasure to leave behind.
Why
would a hero want to leave paradise? He faced unimaginable challenges to
reach
it.

The final push can come in many forms. If he receives a divine favor, the
gods
themselves want him to return. They shared a gift with him that needs to be
shared with others. He feel inspired to return.

The hero may be given chase. If what he gains wasn't obtained with consent,
he
needs to run. This is seen with Jason and the golden fleece. After all
the toils, he must escape to finally obtain his reward.

If the her finds pleasure or a trap, he may need assistance. This can be
a friend, family, or society itself. They need to either assist with the trap
or snap the hero out of a trance. Then he can return with all he has gained.

Regardless of how the hero is triggered to return, it is critical that he
returns. He must share what he gained through his journey. Otherwise, the
entire journey would be for nothing.
