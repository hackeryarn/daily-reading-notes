  <p>Trying to bring what the hero learned into the everyday world can be an impossible task. The hero witnessed a world beyond ours. He caught a glimpse to the inner working in the universe. He understood that the world of myth and ours is one and the same. How can he explain this to the common man that barely knows this other world exists?</p>
<p>The world won’t look the same anymore. The hero won’t be the same anymore. Yet in order to move on he must integrate back into the world. If he thinks that the world is derange and he is above it all, he is at fault. Despite what he gained, he must not place himself above others. This will bring resentment or worse madness.</p>
<p>He is still mortal. The lesson handed down was that of surrender not grandeur. The hero must realize the futility of it all and become an instrument in the world. Being of service to others is his ultimate reward.</p>
