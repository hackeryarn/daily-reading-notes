The world is filled with dualities. Everything, including life and death, is
part of
a greater cohesive whole. They can't be separated and can't survive without
the
balance of the other.

You can see this notion everwhere. When you respond to hate with love, you
are
bringing balance to the whole. With balance, you negate the impact of the
original action. You create a calm once again.

This cancellation of forces is counterintuitive. It means that enlightenment
isn't a gaining power. It's the quenching of the forces around you. The
settling down of the world. You can't be happy in the world if you have
forces
pushing against you at all times.
