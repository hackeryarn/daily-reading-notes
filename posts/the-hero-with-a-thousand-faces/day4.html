  <p>The first challenge a hero faces could be the greatest. He must pass the threshold of his society. This requires him to abandon the warnings uttered since his childhood. To push past the limits of others.</p>
<p>The only way to get past this threshold is to give himself fully to the unknown. He must relinquish his old self and be reborn into a greater form than before.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the sacrifice required makes this the hardest part of the journey. Losing everything he has and being humbled is the least of the sacrifices he might face. Some heroes like the Egyptian god Osiris had to die multiple times to pass their threshold. However, without this sacrifice the hero does not reach his potential and becomes another cautionary tail of the dangers lurking in the outside world.</p>
