  <p>The hero must abandon the view of the father as a villain. This childish view is holding him back from moving into adulthood.</p>
<p>The father could come in many forms. It could be the literal father, an authority figure, or even god. In either cases, the challenge remain the same.</p>
<p>The father appears cruel. He terrifies the hero and force him to seek solace in others. But the hero must see through the immediate consequences of the father’s actions. They are not malicious. They are part of the hero’s rite of passage.</p>
<p>The true hero has nothing to fear in these trials. But an ego driven hero could be undone by them. Like the rest of the journey, they will filter the weak and harden the strong.</p>
