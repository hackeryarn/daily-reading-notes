  <p>A journey starts with a call to adventure, often in a form of a mishap. It could be a broken promise, or a failed duty. These fumbles stem from deeper issues that need to be addressed through the journey to come.</p>
<p>If the hero accepts the call, they are presented with a guardian or an intervention to spur them on their adventure. This can be a blacksmith that provides an amulet for protection, or an image to trigger an important realization. This is the source of courage the hero will need for the trials that face him.</p>
<p>However, the hero could refuse the call. In that case, he will only create more trouble for himself. The call isnâ€™t for the benefit of someone else, as it may first appear. The adventure is there to help the hero. The situation will continue to degrade with further rejection of the call until two option remain. The hero is finally pushed into taking action, or the hero is pushed too far and becomes the villain. Someone that refuses to move on and only creates grief and disaster around themselves.</p>
