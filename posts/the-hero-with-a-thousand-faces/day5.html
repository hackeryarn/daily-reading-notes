  <p>The last obstacle the hero faces tests him in an unexpected way. He doesn’t have to slay a beast or solve a riddle. This challenge requires him to love his fate no matter how grim and vile it seems.</p>
<p>Others wouldn’t even attempt what the hero faces. They lack the divinity to accept the challenges of the world. Unlike others, the hero was prepared for this task by the preceding challenges.</p>
<p>Accomplishing this challenge reveals the hidden beauty. By going through the ugliest of times he will uncover the gems underneath. The frog will become the prince.</p>
<p>This is also true for life, not just stories. To obtain the best things in life we must go through the worst of times. As seen through history, peace and prosperity have to we won through war and sacrifice.</p>
