  <p>We donâ€™t evolve through falling back to tradition nor pushing through to an ideal future. It is through rebirth that we progress in life.</p>
<p>You will come to an impasse where you must give up the past in order to embrace the future. If you decide to cling on to the past, you will never be able to move forward. If you refuse to change with the circumstances, you will deny yourself the opportunities presented to you. This is how people become stagnated in life.</p>
<p>Instead push through your personal challenges, push through the cultural challenges around you. Allow them to mold you into what you need to be. They will prepare you for the next phase of your life.</p>
