Trying to bring what the hero learned into the everyday world can be an
impossible task. The hero witnessed a world beyond ours. He caught a glimpse
to the inner
working in the universe. He understood that the world of myth and ours is
one and the same. How can he explain this to the common man that barely knows
this other world exists?

The world won't look the same anymore. The hero won't be the same anymore.
Yet
in order to move on he must integrate back into the world. If he thinks that
the world is derange and he is above it all, he is at fault. Despite what he
gained, he must not place himself above others. This will bring resentment or
worse madness.

He is still mortal. The lesson handed down was that of surrender not
grandeur.
The hero must realize the futility of it all and become an instrument in the
world. Being of service to others is his ultimate reward.
