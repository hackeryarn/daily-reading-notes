A journey starts with a call to adventure, often in a form of a mishap. It
could be a broken promise, or a failed duty. These fumbles stem from deeper
issues that need to be addressed through the journey to come.

If the hero accepts the call, they are presented with a guardian or an
intervention to spur them on their adventure. This can be a blacksmith that
provides an amulet for protection, or an image to trigger an important
realization. This is the source of courage the hero will need for the trials
that face him.

However, the hero could refuse the call. In that case, he will only create more
trouble for himself. The call isn't for the benefit of someone else,
as it may first appear. The adventure is there to help the hero. The situation will
continue to degrade with further rejection of the call until two option remain.
The hero is finally pushed into taking action, or the hero is pushed too far
and becomes the villain. Someone that refuses to move on and only
creates grief and disaster around themselves.
