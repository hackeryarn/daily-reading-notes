  <p>The myth keeps the same purpose through its evolutions. As society changed, it needed different rituals to band its people together.</p>
<p>When tribes were afraid of the predators around them, they had great heroes to protect them. When villages struggled with the changing seasons, they had ceremonies and gods to prepare them for the season. When the basic needs were met and society started wondering about the afterlife, they invented explanations and trials for the after life. Each cycle produces greater understanding and bring together a greater number of people.</p>
<p>The challenge today is bringing together the entire world. We need to get rid of the cultural barriers that held together smaller tribes. These barriers were useful at one time. Now, they are preventing us from coming together in peace.</p>
<p>Another ogre we must face today is the extreme focus on the self. As the world grows larger it’s easier for individuals to lose touch with society. If they withdraw within unprepared, they become isolated. They get stuck in the early stages of life. They can’t reach their full potential. Before, societies had rituals for helping with progression, but they have been forgotten.</p>
<p>We must bring forth a new kind of myth. A myth that will remind everyone that we are one with the society around us. We are born into society. We can’t survive without society, and it can’t survive without us. Despite the size of the world, we are all still one.</p>
