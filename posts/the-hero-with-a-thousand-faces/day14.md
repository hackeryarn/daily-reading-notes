Once a society progresses to human heroes, they have no need for the
mythological hero. The life giving minotaurs and dragons of the earlier
cultures become the monsters of the new culture.

It is a rare hero that can move into a new age. In order to do this, he must
shed
his mythological past. Like the rest of the world, his story can't stay
permanent. He must evolve if he wants to survive. Otherwise, his energy will
be
used to fuel a new hero.

This cycle makes you wonder what will become of todays heroes in the future.
Will society progress to the point of replacing human heroes with something
else as well?
