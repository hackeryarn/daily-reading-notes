  <p>The victory the hero achieves can be too great a pleasure to leave behind. Why would a hero want to leave paradise? He faced unimaginable challenges to reach it.</p>
<p>The final push can come in many forms. If he receives a divine favor, the gods themselves want him to return. They shared a gift with him that needs to be shared with others. He feel inspired to return.</p>
<p>The hero may be given chase. If what he gains wasnâ€™t obtained with consent, he needs to run. This is seen with Jason and the golden fleece. After all the toils, he must escape to finally obtain his reward.</p>
<p>If the her finds pleasure or a trap, he may need assistance. This can be a friend, family, or society itself. They need to either assist with the trap or snap the hero out of a trance. Then he can return with all he has gained.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the hero is triggered to return, it is critical that he returns. He must share what he gained through his journey. Otherwise, the entire journey would be for nothing.</p>
