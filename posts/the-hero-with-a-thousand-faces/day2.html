  <p>Myths speak to us through familiar stories. We can see ourselves in the hero that goes on a great journey. Where he is separate from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>On this journey, he finds something within himself. A power he didnâ€™t know he possessed - revealed to him through trials. He gains insights into the inner working of the world.</p>
<p>This power allows him to overcome the challenge that forced him on the journey. But it also gives him a gift to share with the rest of the world. Like Prometheus, the hero will use his power to push the entire world forward.</p>
<p>We all go on similar journeys on a smaller scale. There is something within all of us waiting to be realized. We might not be able to effect the entire world like the heroes of myth, but we can effect the people around us.</p>
