Cycle are present in stories throughout the world. These stories weren't made
up by a lone person dreaming up an adventure. They were passed on through
generation. Retold by the most esteemed people of their societies. They
shaped
entire cultures. The cycles within them hold a real representation of what we
see in the world.

The idea of the cyclical world is so common it seeps into saying
we don't pay much attention to anymore. "History repeats itself" isn't just
a convenient saying. It's a profound way to express what we see happening
every
day. An example we all experience, everyday, is sleep.

As we go throughout the day, we are drained of energy. Until finally we are
tired enough to go to sleep. During the deep sleep, we recover our energies
through dreams. A world not quite like ours but very similar. When we wake
up,
we are recharged and proceed through our day. We make use of this energy to
accomplish great things. Until we spend all of our energy once again.

By noticing these types of cycles throughout your life, you can make the bad
times feel better. Every downward spiral is charging you up for an even
greater success.
