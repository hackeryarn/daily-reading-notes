The meaning of many myths has been lost. They are reduced to comedy, romance,
or history. Only a portion of the story is made important. Secondary meanings
were layered over the original. This takes away from the lessons myths are
meant to teach us.

They should show us the cycles of life. Through them we see that our duty is to
answer the call of adventure full heartedly. We much persevere despite the great
obstacles that we face. It's at the worst of times that we win the ultimate
prize and become reborn into a better versions of ourselves. The version that's
needed to change the world.
