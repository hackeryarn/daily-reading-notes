The less understanding the world has, the greater hero it needs. This can be
seen through who cultures consider heroes. When people need to account for
things that can't be explained, they reach for a mythical hero.

This is the type of hero that is given birth from a primordial time or being.
He is
more than human. He is meant to accomplish miracles. He is the ideal for
others
to follow. This creates a base for all the heroes to come. Although it's an
unattainable base, it is a point needed to strive for.

With each hero bringing society to a higher place, it's only a matter of time
before they need to explain less. When that occurs the hero needs to be less
divine. People can see the hero in themselves.

This is the time when societies start looking closer to history. It
looks to the kings that grew the country. It celebrates the veterans of wars.
These are the heroes that a maturing society needs. These are the heroes the
societies people can become.
