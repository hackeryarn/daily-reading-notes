The hero must abandon the view of the father as a villain. This childish view
is
holding him back from moving into adulthood.

The father could come in many forms. It could be the literal father,
an authority figure, or even god. In either cases, the challenge remain the
same.

The father appears cruel. He terrifies the hero and force him to
seek solace in others. But the hero must see through the immediate
consequences
of the father's actions. They are not malicious. They are part of the hero's
rite of passage.

The true hero has nothing to fear in these trials. But an ego driven hero
could
be undone by them. Like the rest of the journey, they will filter the weak
and
harden the strong.
