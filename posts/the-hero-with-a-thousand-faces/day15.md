The myth keeps the same purpose through its evolutions. As society
changed, it needed different rituals to band its people together.

When tribes were afraid of the predators around them, they had great heroes
to
protect them. When villages struggled with the changing seasons, they had
ceremonies and gods to prepare them for the season. When the basic needs were
met and society started wondering about the afterlife, they invented
explanations and trials for the after life. Each cycle produces greater
understanding and bring together a greater number of people.

The challenge today is bringing together the entire world. We need to get rid
of the cultural barriers that held together smaller tribes. These barriers
were
useful at one time. Now, they are preventing us from coming together in
peace.

Another ogre we must face today is the extreme focus on the self. As the
world
grows larger it's easier for individuals to lose touch with society. If they
withdraw within unprepared, they become isolated. They get stuck in the early
stages of life. They can't reach their full potential. Before, societies had
rituals for helping with progression, but they have been forgotten.

We must bring forth a new kind of myth. A myth that will remind everyone that
we are
one with the society around us. We are born into society. We can't survive
without society, and it can't survive without us. Despite the size of the
world, we are all still one.
