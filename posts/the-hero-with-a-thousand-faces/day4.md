The first challenge a hero faces could be the greatest. He must pass the
threshold of his society. This requires him to abandon the
warnings uttered since his childhood. To push past the limits of others.

The only way to get past this threshold is to give himself fully to the
unknown. He must relinquish his old self and be reborn into a greater form than
before.

The magnitude of the sacrifice required makes this the hardest part of the
journey. Losing everything he has and being humbled is the least of the
sacrifices he might face. Some heroes like the Egyptian god Osiris had to die
multiple times to pass their threshold. However, without this sacrifice the
hero does not reach his potential and becomes another cautionary tail of the
dangers lurking in the outside world.
