  <p>Cycle are present in stories throughout the world. These stories weren’t made up by a lone person dreaming up an adventure. They were passed on through generation. Retold by the most esteemed people of their societies. They shaped entire cultures. The cycles within them hold a real representation of what we see in the world.</p>
<p>The idea of the cyclical world is so common it seeps into saying we don’t pay much attention to anymore. “History repeats itself” isn’t just a convenient saying. It’s a profound way to express what we see happening every day. An example we all experience, everyday, is sleep.</p>
<p>As we go throughout the day, we are drained of energy. Until finally we are tired enough to go to sleep. During the deep sleep, we recover our energies through dreams. A world not quite like ours but very similar. When we wake up, we are recharged and proceed through our day. We make use of this energy to accomplish great things. Until we spend all of our energy once again.</p>
<p>By noticing these types of cycles throughout your life, you can make the bad times feel better. Every downward spiral is charging you up for an even greater success.</p>
