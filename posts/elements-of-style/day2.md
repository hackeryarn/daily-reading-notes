Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second one amplifies or further
describes the first. It links the two clauses closer than a semi colon without
requiring a conjunction.

Words between the subject and the verb do not change the number of the verbs. Do
change the word to describe the detail about the subject.

A participial phrase (a phrase that acts as an adjective) at the beginning of a
sentence must describe the subject.
