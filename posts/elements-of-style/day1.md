If two independent clauses share the same subject and joined by a but, separate
them with a comma before the conjunction. If they are joined by an and, omit the
comma.

When joining two closely related independent clauses prefer a semicolon. It is
more direct than using a conjunction.

Only break a sentence in two for high emphasis. In general, reserve this
technique for dialog, when the character speaks in a clipped tone.
