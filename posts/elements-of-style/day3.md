Structure your composition from paragraphs. Every one should have a singular,
clear purpose.

Avoid using the negative form. "Not" and other denials strip the sentence of its
power. Replace them with appropriate adjectives. Tell the reader what is never what
is not.

Infuse your sentences with the right detail. If the piece is filled with
indecision, the reader can't construct a clear mental picture.

Sentences that have the same form dull your writing. Only use the same form to
link similar ideas spread across multiple sentences, making your writing feel
consistent.

Never leave the reader wondering what you are referring to by splitting up
related words. Clarity is your goal in all writing.

Place new or important information at the end of sentences and paragraphs. The
ending position gives emphasis.
