  <p>When we accept our experiences the way they are, we experience our life completely for the first time.</p>
<p>Practice acceptance by sitting with a negative experience and responding with only no to everything that comes up. Notice how your body feels. Then, after a few breaths, change your response to a yes. Notice how your body feels then, even if you’re experiencing negative emotions.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a major problem or failure in life, try to see what’s true about the story that’s playing in your head. Call out only the parts that are actually happening and this moment and sit with those. The rest may never come to pass.</p>
<p>“Dwell as near as possible to the channel in which your life flows.” – Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>Your body experiences everything you feel. Start to notice the sensations that come up with the emotions that you feel.</p>
<p>Our mind tries to judge sensation that come up, but the sensations have many more layers than feeling good or bad.</p>
<p>“Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.”</p>
<p>Don’t conflate painful or unpleasant experiences with wrongness. They are your body’s way of getting your attention, they don’t always lead to something bad. If you try to understand them, they may lead to improvements in your life.</p>
<p>When we let our worries and stories of pain fill our attention, we ignore the many other sensations it can bring. Try to identify the exact feeling of your pain. It could be hot, sharp, dull, or tight. Really feel what your body is trying to tell you.</p>
