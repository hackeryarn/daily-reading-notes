"I Sought my god,
  my god I could not see
I sought my soul,
  my soul eluded me
I sought my brother
  and found all three"
-- Anonymous

We can only unlock our full potential through the relationships we build with
others.

A conversation, a party, or even an argument all present an opportunity to
practice mindfulness. In fact, the more mindful we become throughout our
relationships, the stronger our relationships grow.

When we listen to the troubles of others, we realize that we are not alone.
Everyone is going through similar struggles as us. No one is perfect.

Sometimes a person can only change when they feel accepted for who they are
today. You can give them that acceptance.

To remain mindful in conversations, follow these steps:

- Set an intention to stay present, honest, and kind.
- Let your body be an another, like in meditation.
- Listen from the heart and try to relate on a deeper level.
- Speak from the heart. It's OK to let others know how you feel.
- Pause, relax, and attend. You don't need to hurry a response.
- Practice radical acceptance by meeting the person where they are right now
  without trying to change them.
