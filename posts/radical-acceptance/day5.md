Traumatic experiences can manifest in the body as chronic pain or tightness, or
as uncontrollable bouts during situation that trigger a memory of the
experience.

Our bodily experiences guide us towards fixing not only our physical states, but
also our mental states. 

Once we accept the feeling in our body and become comfortable in them, our body
becomes a home base against the turmoil of the outside world.

Our emotions and bodily sensations never stop changing -- just like the rest of
nature.

Our suffering comes from trying to control our flow of emotions by holding on or
pushing away. If we want to experience life fully, we must allow sensations
to flow freely.

Become familiar with your body by scanning it from head to toe. Give a longer
pause to any area of intense sensation, or areas lacking sensation. Get to know
everything that's happening in your body at the moment.

Practice accepting your pain by digging deeper and trying notice exactly what
the pain feels like. Allow the sensation to spread through your entire body. The
more it spreads the less instance it becomes. Notice how this effects others
parts of the whole body.
