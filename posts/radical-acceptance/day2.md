"The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can
change."
-- Cari Rogers

Acceptance requires clarity and compassion.

We start understanding who we are when we start to see our emotions clearly. But
we can't see clearly unless we have tender compassion towards the things that
come up. Otherwise, we will just cover them up or run away getting to a deeper
level. 

"The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom."

We can only find lasting change once we accept our current situation completely.

When we accept our limits, we get a clear view of what it will take to overcome
them or work around them.

Listening deeply to our cravings lets us see the underlying motivation for
them. Once we know these drivers, we can work with them to make better choices
in the future.
