In our competitive society, it's second nature to harshly judge yourself. We
become so busy blaming ourselves for failing to reaching an unattainable standard
that we forget to notice everything we have accomplishing.

You should relate to yourself like you would a friend. You wouldn't let a friend
pile on responsibility when they are in a tough situation. Don't treat yourself
any differently.

Sometimes your situation becomes so overwhelming that you can't handle it
anymore. That's when you need to reach to a power greater than yourself. Ask for
help with your suffering.

When we share our burden it we can experience all our emotions without needing to hold
the whole weight on our own.

To practice holding your suffering, sit in meditation and start notice your
suffering, your fear, your anger. Let it freely flow and feel it intensify
throughout your body. Then, ask with compassion to be free from it. You can ask
a higher power or just to yourself.

"It's not our anger, it is not our pain. Everyone lives with anger, with fear,
with grief."

Noticing the life around us is the most basic form of loving it. As we spend
more time noticing, we can grow to love even the bugs that scared us at
one point.

If we take the time to think through a situation where someone made us angry or
ashamed, we start to see that the person who hurt us is suffering like we are.

When we see someone as other or different, we block out the rest of their
humanity. If instead, we look for similarities, we will find them much more like
us than different.

Even if we don't like someone, or disagree with their ideas, if we start to see
their humanity we can understand them. This will facilitate better conversation
and could lead to compromises and solutions that wouldn't be possible otherwise.
