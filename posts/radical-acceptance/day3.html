  <p>Some situations require our careful attention and control. Others, require us to let go completely and just allow the moment to unfold.</p>
<p>We only see what’s happening around us when we stop doing.</p>
<p>“By running from what we fear, we feed the inner darkness.”</p>
<p>When we deny and defend against what someone said, we not only frustrate the other person, but we also keep ourselves from accepting the truth – even if it’s only partial – and feelings that their comments brings up.</p>
<p>By embracing and welcoming our emotions as they are, we take away the extra power they gain from the stories surrounding them.</p>
<p>The pause brings the most benefit in the moment when it’s the hardest to find. We must practice pausing in the face of anger, anxiety, and shame. Only then can we effectively work with our most difficult emotions.</p>
<p>Practice pausing by choosing one activity in your day and taking a few moments before starting it.</p>
<p>“Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.” – Rumi, referring to our feelings</p>
<p>If we want to accept our emotions, we must drop the judgment and worries that surround them. Ask yourself “what demands your attention at this moment?” Let the rest fall away.</p>
<p>Naming your emotions can be enough to overcome them.</p>
<p>Treat yourself like you would a friend. Support yourself so you can fully feel everything you are experiencing.</p>
