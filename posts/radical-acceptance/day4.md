When we accept our experiences the way they are, we experience our life completely
for the first time.

Practice acceptance by sitting with a negative experience and responding with
only no to everything that comes up. Notice how your body feels. Then, after a
few breaths, change your response to a yes. Notice how your body feels then,
even if you're experiencing negative emotions.

When you are dealing with a major problem or failure in life, try to see what's
true about the story that's playing in your head. Call out only the parts that
are actually happening and this moment and sit with those. The rest may never
come to pass.

"Dwell as near as possible to the channel in which your life flows."
-- Henry David Thoreau

Your body experiences everything you feel. Start to notice the sensations that
come up with the emotions that you feel.

Our mind tries to judge sensation that come up, but the sensations have many
more layers than feeling good or bad.

"Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional."

Don't conflate painful or unpleasant experiences with wrongness. They are your
body's way of getting your attention, they don't always lead to something bad.
If you try to understand them, they may lead to improvements in your life.

When we let our worries and stories of pain fill our attention, we ignore the
many other sensations it can bring. Try to identify the exact feeling of your
pain. It could be hot, sharp, dull, or tight. Really feel what your body is
trying to tell you.
