When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we miss all the
potential for greatness we have inside us.

Frustration or losses or our temper can make us doubt our good
nature, but they hold little truth. When given time and compassion
they quickly fade.

To loosen attachments to these feeling and doubts about our nature, we
can ask ourselves "Who is aware of this?" This will open us to seeing
that the only permanent thing is the sense of awareness itself.

"Seeing pure awareness without engaging lovingly with our life is a
daydream. Living in this relative world is a nightmare."
-- Japanese Proverb

To live a fulfilling live, we need to loosen our attachments and
engage in daily life at the same time. Inside this delicate balance
lies calmness and happiness.

Cherish every step you take in a difficult situation. Even the
smallest nudge forward represents progress that will compound over time.
