A perpetual state of not being good enough drives much of our day to day
striving. We feel like we have to work harder, earn more, and look better.

The feeling of being unworthy alienates us from others by making us feel like we
don't deserve their love. Not getting the love and attention that we naturally
need causes us to drift further into unworthiness creating a vicious cycle. 

People try to embrace many practices, including meditation, to run away from the
feeling of inadequacy. But running away only temporarily relieves those
feelings. 

Western society makes us feel unworthy from the day we are born. Our parents
want us to be healthy and successful. They push on us these standards in good
faith, but they end up making us feel like we can never measure up to their
expectations.

The idea of having something wrong with us if further perpetuated by the
ingrained notion of original sin. We believe that we have to fix something about
ourselves before we become worthy of happiness.

We create many techniques for dealing with these damaging feelings: 

- We keep finding new self improvement projects.
- We hold back from our full potential, because we believe, as Homer Simpson
  said "Trying is the first step to failure."
- We withdraw from experiencing the moment we have because everything that
  happens sets off our worries.
- We keep endlessly busy while pushing away the people that genuinely care for
  us.
- We become our own biggest critic because we believe that if we catch our
  mistakes first others won't get the chance to hurt us.
- We blame others to absolve ourselves from the responsibility for our own
  actions.
  
All these strategies treat ourselves as separate from the world, and make us
believe that only we have these problems.

The first step to overcoming these feeling of inadequacy is noticing when we
feel dissatisfied, and remembering that we are not alone in how we feel.
