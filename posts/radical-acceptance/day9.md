When our heart shuts down to others, we only see the manifestations of their
wants and suffering. We can't help them by trying to fix the surface level
problems. To help someone, we have to understand what they want at a fundamental
level. 

The only way to understand someone's situation is to see it through their eyes.
Someone blaming or berating you could be out of care or their own helplessness.
You won't know until you take their perspective.

Kindness is the basic goodness in the world. When you spend time with others,
new or familiar, ask yourself "How can I be more kind?"

Our circle of influence is smaller than we like to believe. We can only hope to
help the person we are with right now.

"We can do no great things -- only small things with great love."
-- Mother Teresa

To build you compassion you have to feel the grief of yourself or others. Sit
with your breath and bring forward a painful experience you went through, or an
experience you saw someone else struggle with. When you breath in, touch
the suffering and allow yourself to feel it completely. When you breath out,
release the suffering into the wide open space with a prayer for relief.
