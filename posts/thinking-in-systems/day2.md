Stocks are the tangible elements of a system.

Flows are the mechanisms that fill or drain stocks. The balance
between the flows of a system will determine the behavior and level of
the stock.

All system representations are simplifications of the real world.

A dynamic equilibrium occurs when at least one in flow and at least
one outflow if present, but the level of the stock doesn't change.

People quickly realize that increasing the in flow will grow the
stock. But they miss that decreasing the outflow, while maintaining
the inflow, will also increase the stock.

A change in the flow dynamics could take a long time to tangibly
effect the stock.

Stocks act as buffers in the system allowing temporary decoupling of
the in flows and out flows.

Feedback occurs in the system when the level of the stock can effect
one of it's flows. This process allows the system to self regulate.

A balancing feedback loop keeps the stock within a range or tries to
reach an equilibrium enforced by an external factor to the flow. An
example of reaching an equilibrium is a cup of hot coffee cooling off
as it sits in a cold room.

Self reinforcing loops occur when the amount of stock enhances the
rate of flow. This leads to exponential growth or runaway collapse. 

Besides trivial examples, almost every system has a form of a feedback
loop.
