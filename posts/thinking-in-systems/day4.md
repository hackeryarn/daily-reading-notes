In a physical exponentially growing system, there will always be one
reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least on balancing loop
constraining the growth. This ensures that no system grows forever.

In a two stock system, as the resource become more scarce, it becomes
harder to obtain and therefore rises in price.

Two stock systems can depend on two types of resources: non-renewable, and
renewable. 

Systems that depend on a non-renewable resources will reach and end of the
stock and therefore the system. The only thing that can be controlled
in this type of system is the amount of time the stock will last.

The amount of the resource makes little difference if the growth is
exponential.

To control how long the stock lasts, the extraction rate must be
closely controlled. The faster the extraction rate grows and
higher it gets, the more capital the stock will produce, but the
shorter life it will have.

Systems that depend on renewable resources can provide resources
indefinitely, but require a delicate balancing act.

If the system has a strong balancing loop and low technological
advances, they can reach a point of balance with the renewable
resource.

If the system has a weaker balancing loop, or technological advances
allow further resource extraction without a cost increase. Then, the
system will never reach an even balance. Instead, it will oscillate
around the ideal balance point.

A renewable resource can also turn non-renewable if the balancing loop
is too weak. In this case, the reinforcing regenerating loop of the
resource becomes dominated by the balancing loop of extraction and the
resource stock starts declining into extinction.
