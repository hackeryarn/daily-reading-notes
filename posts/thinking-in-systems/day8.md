Systems remain in a constant state of change. If we want them to
change in a favorable way we much use the most effective point of
leverage available to us.

The leverage points -- in order of effectiveness:

- Numbers: have a minor effect on the system, unless they represent
  concrete goals or limits in the overall system. All minor
  adjustments get compensated for by other aspects of the system.
- Buffers: work to change the system because they control the
  resiliency of a system by changing the levels of stock available.
  They aren't an effective means of managing systems, however, because
  they are usually physical thus extremely hard or time consuming to
  change.
- Delays: can have major effects on systems. Most of the time,
  however, They stem from physical limitations and therefore lay
  outside anyone's control. 
- Balancing feedback loops: modify an aspect of a system when they
  become strengthened or made to react at different speeds. 
- Reinforcing feedback loops: have a larger effect on a system than
  balancing feedback loops because of the exponential nature of
  reinforcing feedback loops.
- Information flows: can simultaneously change multiple aspects of the
  system by creating entirely need feedback loops between system
  components.
- Rules: encourage or discourage particular behaviors in the system.
  Since they rarely come from physical limitations, they can be
  easily changed with dramatic effects on the system.
- Self-organization: gives an easy way to move the system forward from
  within. By adding, subtracting, or evolving components, rippling
  effects are created in the entire system.
- Goals: drive the behavior of all the components in the system. If
  you can modify a goal of a system, the entire nature of the
  system can change.
- Paradigms: are the unspoken rules and goals in the system. They
  drive behavior of a system at the most basic level. If you can shift
  a paradigm, then you can have an impact on multiple goals and
  components at once.
- Transcending paradigms: allows an actor or a system to adapt to it's
  surrounding without becoming tied down to any one paradigm. This is
  the hardest change to achieve. But, if you can reach this point, you
  will have a harmonious system that can exist friction  free in the
  ever changing world around it.
  
As the effectiveness of leverage points grows, so does the difficulty
of implementing them. Any established system will resist change,
especially change as radical as a paradigm shift.
