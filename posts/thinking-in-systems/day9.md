Analyzing systems doesn't turn the whole world into a mechanical
construct for us to optimize. Deep exploration exposes the human
side that we can't easily change or understand. It brings up the same
set of philosophical question people have struggled with for
centuries.

Every system has it's own rhythm. Before you try to change or even
work within a system, take the time to understand it's unique way of
operating.

Write down, draw, and explain your mental model to yourself and
others. This process will make your understanding concrete and allow
you to work with others.

Exposing more information to the right people can fix many underlying
system problems.

Especially when dealing with systems, use clear language and add
vocabulary to aid with understanding.

You can't quantify many of the most important aspects of a system.
Don't allow the ones you can quantify overshadow resiliency, honesty,
and justice.

To greatly improve the efficiency in systems create direct feedback
policies. These will enable better operation by giving the right
information to the people that need to modify their behavior.

Any system that favors individual interests over the good of the whole
is doomed.

Allow the system to show you the best course of action. Don't assume
that what worked in one system will work in another.

Information gets hidden when responsibility gets reduced. For example,
wars got worse when leaders didn't have to lead their army.

We will never understand a system completely. They are too complex.
Therefore, we must embrace constant adjustment and admit the errors we
will inevitably make.

The best people to make system decisions are holistic thinkers that
care deeply about the good of the whole.
