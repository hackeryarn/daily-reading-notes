Systems work well because of three characteristics: resilience,
self-organization, and hierarchy.

Although there are always limits to resilience, a resilient system can
recover from unexpected events or damages.

A system gains resilience by having multiple feedback loops that can
restore the system balance through different circumstances.

The system can gain more resilience by having backup loops, loops that
can rebuild other feedback loops, or loops that can learn, grow, and
evolve.

Resilience requires a level of chaos diminishes predictability and
short term efficiency.

Because people desire predictability and optimization of a single
outcome, they cause systems to lose their resilience.

Self-organizing systems can make their own structure more complex.
This leads to systems that can evolve to find new and improved ways of
going about their task.

Like with fractals, self-organization of a system produces complex
results by following a set of simple rules.

Self-organization is often taken for granted, and because of this it
gets sacrificed for the same reasons as resiliency.

Hierarchies naturally form in systems from the bottom up when a higher
level system can help a lower system.

If any subsystem goal dominates the goal of the whole system, then
the entire system becomes sub-optimized.
