Popular opinions become entrenched in the tissue of society whether
it's valid or not. For people to look at measuring length differently,
it took Lewis Fry Richardson noticing discrepancies in the length of
borders while investigating the cause for war.

By noticing that as the scale decreased, the size of borders
increased, Richardson accidentally discovered a fractal dimension.

The fractal nature of object mean that the rougher an object becomes,
the closer it gets to gaining another dimensions. In the example of
borders, a single dimension border with a jagged enough coast line
gains mathematical properties of a two dimensional object.

Mandelbrot expanded on Richardson's finding by noticing that the
fractal state was the norm in the natural world and not the exception
-- as many Euclidean idealists would like to believe.

Fractals lead to the unique scaling properties of plants, living
organisms, cities, companies, and even markets. The influence of
fractals spread to anything that maintains a similar structure at
different levels or behaves similarly at different time scales.
