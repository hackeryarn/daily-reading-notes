Although many aspects change with scale, there are certain invariant
aspects to every system and stay consistent -- like average heart rate
for all people.

Scaling drug dosages from animals to people, or even to kids of
different ages remains a challenge. Going from one organism to another
rarely has identical interactions, and the scaling remains non linear
even in the same organisms.

It remains difficult to determine truly invariant factors from simply
slow changing ones.

The BMI index incorrectly because it takes weight increase by a factor
of two, while it should use a factor of three -- corresponding to the
increase in volume.

If we wish to surpass physical limitations of growth, we
must innovate by changing materials, design, or the environment
surrounding the system.
