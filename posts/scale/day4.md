Scaling theory enables simulations at a fraction of the cost and
effort of building the real thing.

Scale invariance represent relationships within a system that don't
change regardless of scale or measuring system. These invariances
enable the expression of scale as a mathematical formula.

Despite many systems having accurate mathematical representations,
these formulas often because uselessly complex. Instead of calculating
the solution outright, solving these problems require modeling or simulations.

It's unlikely that there are "Universal Laws of Biology," but it is
likely that there are formulas that provide quantitative understanding
of biological systems. For example, we may never have the ability to
calculate how long you will live, but we might figure out how to
calculate the maximum age you could live.
