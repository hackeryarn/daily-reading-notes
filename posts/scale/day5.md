For much of it's existence biology has been a qualitative science
without a unifying theory underlain by mathematics.

All the processes of life, even sleep, require energy. The amount of
energy an organism needs to sustain basic operation is governed by
it's metabolism.

As the size of an organism increases, it's metabolic rate only
increases by a factor of 3/4. This provide every doubling in size with
an energy savings of 25%.

Almost all biological scaling laws are multiples of 1/4. This
thread leads to a commonality among the diverse aspects of life and
provide a strong case for a uniting principle that's far less random
than natural selection.
