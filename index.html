    <p>
      I use this site to write my daily reading notes for books that I learn from
      and which influence me. You can expect a short post on the key themes, what
      I've learned, or how my thinking has changed because of what I read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I condense tens of pages into a few paragraphs there is no way
      I can do justice to even the main ideas of the book. If you find any of the
      notes interesting, I encourage you to read the book for yourself and compare
      your ideas with mine.
