    <p>
      I use this site to write my daily reading notes for books that I learn from
      and influence me. You can expect a short post on the key themes, what
      I've learned, or how my thinking has changed.

      Because I condense many pages into a few paragraphs, there is no way
      I can do justice to the books. If you find any of the
      notes interesting, I encourage you to read the book for yourself and
      compare your ideas with mine.
